<speech>
<speaker>2 Gent.</speaker>
<line>But what&#8217;s the matter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1.</speaker>
<line>His daughter, and the heire of&#8217;s kingdome (whom</line>
<line>He purpos&#8217;d to his wiues &#383;ole Sonne, a Widdow</line>
<line>That late he married) hath referr&#8217;d her &#383;elfe</line>

<line>None but the King?</line>

<line>He that hath lo&#383;t her too: &#383;o is the Queene,</line>
<line>That mo&#383;t de&#383;ir&#8217;d the Match. But not a Courtier,</line>
<line>Although they weare their faces to the bent</line>
<line>Of the Kings lookes, hath a heart that is not</line>
<line>Glad at the thing they &#383;cowle at.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2</speaker>
<line>And why &#383;o?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1</speaker>
<line>He that hath mi&#383;s&#8217;d the Prince&#383;&#383;e, is a thing</line>
<line>Too bad, for bad report: and he that hath her,</line>
<line>(I meane, that married her, alacke good man,</line>
<line>And therefore bani&#383;h&#8217;d) is a Creature, &#383;uch,</line>
<line>As to &#383;eeke through the Regions of the Earth</line>
<line>For one, his like; there would be &#383;omething failing</line>
<line>In him, that &#383;hould compare. I do not thinke,</line>
<line>So faire an Outward, and &#383;uch &#383;tuffe Within</line>
<line>Endowes a man, but hee.</line>

<line>Again&#383;t the Romanes, with <nameref>Ca&#383;&#383;ibulan</nameref>,</line>

<line>Two other Sonnes, who in the Warres o&#8217;th&#8217;time</line>

<line>That he quit Being; and his gentle Lady</line>

<line>Breedes him, and makes him of his Bed-chamber,</line>
<line>Puts to him all the Learnings that his time</line>
<line>Could make him the receiuer of, which he tooke</line>
<line>As we do ayre, fa&#383;t as &#8217;twas mini&#383;tred,</line>

<stagedir>Enter Philario, Iachimo: a Frenchman, a Dutch-man, and a Spaniard.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>Beleeue it Sir, I haue &#383;eene him in Britaine; hee</line> 
<line>was then of a Cre&#383;&#383;ent note, expe&#392;ted to proue &#383;o woor-</line>
<line>thy, as &#383;ince he hath beene allowed the name of. But I</line> 
<line>could then haue look&#8217;d on him, without the help of Ad-</line>
<line>miration, though the Catalogue of his endowments had</line> 
<line>bin tabled by his &#383;ide, and I to peru&#383;e him by Items.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<line>You &#383;peake of him when he was le&#383;&#383;e furni&#383;h&#8217;d,</line> 
<line>then now hee is, with that which makes him both with-</line>
<line>out, and within.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>French.</speaker>
<line>I haue &#383;eene him in France: wee had very ma-</line>
<line>ny there, could behold the Sunne, with as firme eyes as</line> 
<line>hee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>This matter of marrying his Kings Daughter,</line> 
<line>wherein he mu&#383;t be weighed rather by her valew, then</line> 
<line>his owne, words him (I doubt not) a great deale from the</line> 
<line>matter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>French.</speaker>
<line>And then his bani&#383;hment.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>I, and the approbation of tho&#383;e that weepe this</line> 
<line>lamentable diuorce vnder her colours, are wonderfully</line> 
<line>to extend him, be it but to fortifie her iudgement, which</line> 
<line>el&#383;e an ea&#383;ie battery might lay flat, for taking a Begger</line> 
<line>without le&#383;&#383;e quality. But how comes it, he is to &#383;oiourne</line> 
<line>with you? How creepes acquaintance?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<line>His Father and I were Souldiers together, to</line> 
<line>whom I haue bin often bound for no le&#383;&#383;e then my life.</line> 

<stagedir>Enter Po&#383;thumus.</stagedir> 

<line>Heere comes the Britaine. Let him be &#383;o entertained a-</line>
<line>mong&#8217;&#383;t you, as &#383;uites with Gentlemen of your knowing,</line> 
<line>to a Stranger of his quality. I be&#383;eech you all be better</line> 
<line>knowne to this Gentleman, whom I commend to you,</line> 
<line>as a Noble Friend of mine. How Worthy he is, I will</line> 
<line>leaue to appeare hereafter, rather then &#383;tory him in his</line> 
<line>owne hearing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>French.</speaker>
<line>Sir, we haue knowne togither in Orleance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Po&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>Since when, I haue bin debtor to you for courte-</line>
<line>&#383;ies, which I will be euer to pay, and yet pay &#383;till.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>French.</speaker>
<line>Sir, you o&#8217;re-rate my poore kindne&#383;&#383;e, I was</line> 
<line>glad I did attone my Countryman and you: it had beene</line> 
<line>pitty you &#383;hould haue beene put together, with &#383;o mor-</line>
<line>tall a purpo&#383;e, as then each bore, vpon importance of &#383;o</line> 
<line>&#383;light and triuiall a nature.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Po&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>By your pardon Sir, I was then a young Trauel-</line>
<line>ler, rather &#383;hun&#8217;d to go euen with what I heard, then in</line> 
<line>my euery a&#392;tion to be guided by others experiences: but</line> 
<line>vpon my mended iudgement (if I offend to &#383;ay it is men-</line>
<line>ded) my Quarrell was not altogether &#383;light.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>French.</speaker>
<line>Faith yes, to be put to the arbiterment of</line> 
<line>Swords, and by &#383;uch two, that would by all likelyhood</line> 
<line>haue confounded one the other, or haue falne both.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>Can we with manners, aske what was the dif-</line>
<line>ference?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>French.</speaker>
<line>Safely, I thinke, &#8217;twas a contention in pub-</line>
<line>licke, which may (without contradi&#392;tion) &#383;uffer the re-</line>
<line>port. It was much like an argument that fell out la&#383;t</line> 
<line>night, where each of vs fell in prai&#383;e of our Country-</line>
<line>Mi&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es. This Gentleman, at that time vouching (and</line> 
<line>vpon warrant of bloody affirmation) his to be more</line> 
<line>Faire, Vertuous, Wi&#383;e, Cha&#383;te, Con&#383;tant, Qualified, and</line> 
<line>le&#383;&#383;e attemptible then any, the rare&#383;t of our Ladies in</line> 
<line>Fraunce.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>That Lady is not now liuing; or this Gentle-</line>
<line>mans opinion by this, worne out.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Po&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>She holds her Vertue &#383;till, and I my mind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>You mu&#383;t not &#383;o farre preferre her, &#8217;fore ours of</line>
<line>Italy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Po&#383;th.</speaker>
<line>Being &#383;o farre prouok&#8217;d as I was in France: I</line> 
<line>would abate her nothing, though I profe&#383;&#383;e my &#383;elfe her</line> 
<line>Adorer, not her Friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>As faire, and as good: a kind of hand in hand</line> 
<line>compari&#383;on, had beene &#383;omething too faire, and too</line> 
<line>good for any Lady in Britanie; if &#383;he went before others.</line> 
<line>I haue &#383;eene as that Diamond of yours out-lu&#383;ters many</line> 
<line>I haue beheld, I could not beleeue &#383;he excelled many:</line> 
<line>but I haue not &#383;eene the mo&#383;t pretious Diamond that is,</line> 
<line>nor you the Lady.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Po&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>I prais&#8217;d her, as I rated her: &#383;o do I my Stone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>What do you e&#383;teeme it at?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Po&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>More then the world enioyes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>Either your vnparagon&#8217;d Mi&#383;tris is dead, or</line> 
<line>&#383;he&#8217;s out-priz&#8217;d by a trifle.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Po&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>You are mi&#383;taken: the one may be &#383;olde or gi-</line>
<line>uen, or if there were wealth enough for the purcha&#383;es, or</line> 
<line>merite for the guift. The other is not a thing for &#383;ale,</line> 
<line>and onely the guift of the Gods.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>Which the Gods haue giuen you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Po&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>Which by their Graces I will keepe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>You may weare her in title yours: but you</line> 
<line>know &#383;trange Fowle light vpon neighbouring Ponds.</line> 
<line>Your Ring may be &#383;tolne too, &#383;o your brace of vnprizea-</line>
<line>ble E&#383;timations, the one is but fraile, and the other Ca&#383;u-</line>
<line>all; A cunning Thiefe, or a (that way) accompli&#383;h&#8217;d</line> 
<line>Courtier, would hazzard the winning both of fir&#383;t and</line> 
<line>la&#383;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Po&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>Your Italy, containes none &#383;o accompli&#383;h&#8217;d a</line> 
<line>Courtier to conuince the Honour of my Mi&#383;tris: if in the</line> 
<line>holding or lo&#383;&#383;e of that, you terme her fraile, I do no-</line>
<line>thing doubt you haue &#383;tore of Theeues, notwith&#383;tanding</line> 
<line>I feare not my Ring.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<line>Let vs leaue heere, Gentlemen?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Po&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>Sir, with all my heart. This worthy Signior I</line> 
<line>thanke him, makes no &#383;tranger of me, we are familiar at</line> 
<line>fir&#383;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>With fiue times &#383;o much conuer&#383;ation, I &#383;hould</line> 
<line>get ground of your faire Mi&#383;tris; make her go backe, e-</line>
<line>uen to the yeilding, had I admittance, and opportunitie</line> 
<line>to friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Po&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>No, no.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>I dare thereupon pawne the moytie of my E-</line>
<line>&#383;tate, to your Ring, which in my opinion o&#8217;re-values it</line> 
<line>&#383;omething: but I make my wager rather again&#383;t your</line> 
<line>Confidence, then her Reputation. And to barre your of-</line>
<line>fence heerein to, I dur&#383;t attempt it again&#383;t any Lady in</line> 
<line>the world.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Po&#383;t.</speaker>
<line>You are a great deale abus&#8217;d in too bold a per-</line>
<line>&#383;wa&#383;ion, and I doubt not you &#383;u&#383;taine what y&#8217;are worthy</line> 
<line>of, by your Attempt.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>

<line>dainely, let it dye as it was borne, and I pray you be bet-</line>
<line>ter acquainted.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>Would I had put my E&#383;tate, and my Neighbors</line>

</speech>

<speech>

<line>And that mo&#383;t venerable man, which I</line>
<line>Did call my Father, was, I know not where</line>
<line>When I was &#383;tampt. Some Coyner with his Tooles</line>
<line>Made me a counterfeit: yet my Mother &#383;eem&#8217;d</line>
<line>The <nameref>Dian</nameref> of that time: &#383;o doth my Wife</line>
<line>The Non-pareill of this. Oh Vengeance, Vengeance!</line>
<line>Me of my lawfull plea&#383;ure &#383;he re&#383;train&#8217;d,</line>

<line>But what he look&#8217;d for, &#383;hould oppo&#383;e, and &#383;he</line>
<line>Should from encounter guard. Could I finde out</line>
<line>The Womans part in me, for there&#8217;s no motion</line>
<line>That tends to vice in man, but I affirme</line>
<line>It is the Womans part: be it Lying, note it,</line>
<line>The womans: Flattering, hers; Deceiuing, hers:</line>
<line>Lu&#383;t, and ranke thoughts, hers, hers: Reuenges hers:</line>
<line>Ambitions, Couetings, change of Prides, Di&#383;daine,</line>
<line>Nice-longing, Slanders, Mutability;</line>
<line>All Faults that name, nay, that Hell knowes,</line>
<line>Why hers, in part, or all: but rather all. For euen to Vice</line>
<line>They are not con&#383;tant, but are changing &#383;till;</line>
<line>One Vice, but of a minute old, for one</line>
<line>Not halfe &#383;o old as that. Ile write again&#383;t them,</line>
<line>Dete&#383;t them, cur&#383;e them: yet &#8217;tis greater Skill</line>
