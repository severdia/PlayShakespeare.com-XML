<line>My Liege, I did deny no Pri&#383;oners.</line>

<line>When I was dry with Rage, and extreame Toyle,</line>
<line>Breathle&#383;&#383;e, and Faint, leaning vpon my Sword,</line>
<line>Came there a certaine Lord, neat and trimly dre&#383;t;</line>

<line>Shew&#8217;d like a &#383;tubble Land at Harue&#383;t home.</line>
<line>He was perfumed like a Milliner,</line>
<line>And &#8217;twixt his Finger and his Thumbe, he held</line>
<line>A Pouncet-box: which euer and anon</line>
<line>He gaue his No&#383;e, and took&#8217;t away againe:</line>
<line>Who therewith angry, when it next came there,</line>
<line>Tooke it in Snu&#64256;e. And &#383;till he &#383;mil&#8217;d and talk&#8217;d:</line>
<line>And as the Souldiers bare dead bodies by,</line>
<line>He call&#8217;d them vntaught Knaues, Vnmannerly,</line>

<line>The King is kinde:</line>

<line>My Father, my Vnckle, and my &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>Did giue him that &#383;ame Royaltie he weares:</line>
<line>And when he was not &#383;ixe and twentie &#383;trong,</line>
<line>Sicke in the Worlds regard, wretched, and low,</line>
<line>A poore vnminded Out-law, &#383;neaking home,</line>
<line>My Father gaue him welcome to the &#383;hore:</line>
<line>And when he heard him &#383;weare, and vow to God,</line>
<line>He came but to be Duke of Lanca&#383;ter,</line>
<line>To &#383;ue his Liuerie, and begge his Peace,</line>
<line>With teares of Innocencie, and tearmes of Zeale;</line>
<line>My Father, in kinde heart and pitty mou&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Swore him a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance, and perform&#8217;d it too.</line>
<line>Now, when the Lords and Barons of the Realme</line>

<line>Euen at the heeles, in golden multitudes.</line>
<line>He pre&#383;ently, as Greatne&#383;&#383;e knowes it &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>Step me a little higher then his Vow</line>
<line>Made to my Father, while his blood was poore,</line>
<line>Vpon the naked &#383;hore at Rauen&#383;purgh:</line>

<line>That lay too heauie on the Common-wealth;</line>
<line>Cryes out vpon abu&#383;es, &#383;eemes to weepe</line>
<line>Ouer his Countries Wrongs: and by this Face,</line>
<line>This &#383;eeming Brow of Iu&#383;tice, did he winne</line>
<line>The hearts of all that hee did angle for.</line>
<line>Proceeded further, cut me o&#64256; the Heads</line>

<line>terfeit; to dye, is to be a counterfeit, for hee is but the</line>
<line>counterfeit of a man, who hath not the life of a man: But</line>
<line>to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby liueth, is to be</line>
<line>no counterfeit, but the true and perfe&#392;t image of life in-</line>
<line>deede. The better part of Valour, is Di&#383;cretion; in the</line>
<line>which better part, I haue &#383;aued my life. I am a&#64256;raide of</line>
<line>this Gun-powder <nameref>Percy</nameref> though he be dead. How if hee</line>

<line>proue the better counterfeit: therefore Ile make him &#383;ure:</line>
<line>yea, and Ile &#383;weare I kill&#8217;d him. Why may not hee ri&#383;e as</line>
<line>well as I: Nothing confutes me but eyes, and no-bodie</line>
