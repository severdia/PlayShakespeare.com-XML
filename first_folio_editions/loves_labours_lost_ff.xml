<speaker>Longauill.</speaker>
<line>I am re&#383;olu&#8217;d, &#8217;tis but a three yeeres fa&#383;t:</line>
<line>The minde &#383;hall banquet, though the body pine,</line>
<line>Fat paunches haue leane pates: and dainty bits,</line>
<line>Make rich the ribs, but bankerout the wits.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dumane.</speaker>
<line>My louing Lord, <nameref>Dumane</nameref> is mortified,</line>
<line>The gro&#383;&#383;er manner of the&#383;e worlds delights,</line>
<line>He throwes vpon the gro&#383;&#383;e worlds ba&#383;er &#383;laues:</line>
<line>To loue, to wealth, to pompe, I pine and die,</line>
<line>With all the&#383;e liuing in Philo&#383;ophie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Berowne.</speaker>
<line>I can but &#383;ay their prote&#383;tation ouer,</line>
<line>So much, deare Liege, I haue already &#383;worne,</line>
<line>That is, to liue and &#383;tudy heere three yeeres.</line>
<line>But there are other &#383;tri&#392;t ob&#383;eruances:</line>
<line>As not to &#383;ee a woman in that terme,</line>
<line>Which I hope well is not enrolled there.</line>
<line>And one day in a weeke to touch no foode:</line>
<line>And but one meale on euery day be&#383;ide:</line>
<line>The which I hope is not enrolled there.</line>
<line>And then to &#383;leepe but three houres in the night,</line>
<line>And not be &#383;eene to winke of all the day.</line>
<line>When I was wont to thinke no harme all night,</line>
<line>And make a darke night too of halfe the day:</line>
<line>Which I hope well is not enrolled there.</line>
<line>O, the&#383;e are barren taskes, too hard to keepe,</line>
<line>Not to &#383;ee Ladies, &#383;tudy, fa&#383;t, not &#383;leepe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ferd.</speaker>
<line>Your oath is pa&#383;t, to pa&#383;&#383;e away from the&#383;e.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Berow.</speaker>
<line>Let me &#383;ay no my Liedge, and if you plea&#383;e,</line>
<line>I onely &#383;wore to &#383;tudy with your grace,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Berow.</speaker>
<line>By yea and nay &#383;ir, than I &#383;wore in ie&#383;t.</line>
<line>What is the end of &#383;tudy, let me know?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fer.</speaker>
<line>Why that to know which el&#383;e wee &#383;hould not </line>
<line>know.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ber.</speaker>
<line>Things hid &amp; bard (you meane) fr&#333; c&#333;mon &#383;ense.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ferd.</speaker>
<line>I, that is &#383;tudies god-like recompence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bero.</speaker>
<line>Come on then, I will &#383;weare to &#383;tudie &#383;o,</line>
<line>To know the thing I am forbid to know:</line>
<line>As thus, to &#383;tudy where I well may dine,</line>
<line>When I to fa&#383;t expre&#383;&#383;ely am forbid.</line>
<line>Or &#383;tudie where to meete &#383;ome Mi&#383;tre&#383;&#383;e fine,</line>
<line>When Mi&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es from common &#383;en&#383;e are hid.</line>
<line>Or hauing &#383;worne too hard a keeping oath,</line>
<line>Studie to breake it, and not breake my troth.</line>
<line>If &#383;tudies gaine be thus, and this be &#383;o,</line>
<line>Studie knowes that which yet it doth not know,</line>
<line>Sweare me to this, and I will nere &#383;ay no.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ferd.</speaker>
<line>The&#383;e be the &#383;tops that hinder &#383;tudie quite,</line>
<line>And traine our intelle&#392;ts to vaine delight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ber.</speaker>
<line>Why? all delights are vaine, and that mo&#383;t vaine</line>
<line>Which with paine purchas&#8217;d, doth inherit paine,</line>
<line>As painefully to poare vpon a Booke,</line>
<line>To &#383;eeke the light of truth, while truth the while</line>
<line>Doth fal&#383;ely blinde the eye-&#383;ight of his looke:</line>
<line>Light &#383;eeking light, doth light of light beguile:</line>
<line>So ere you finde where light in darkene&#383;&#383;e lies,</line>
<line>Your light growes darke by lo&#383;ing of your eyes.</line>
<line>Studie me how to plea&#383;e the eye indeede,</line>
<line>By fixing it vpon a fairer eye,</line>
<line>Who dazling &#383;o, that eye &#383;hall be his heed,</line>
<line>And giue him light that it was blinded by.</line>
<line>Studie is like the heauens glorious Sunne,</line>
<line>That will not be deepe &#383;earch&#8217;d with &#383;awcy lookes:</line>
<line>Small haue continuall plodders euer wonne,</line>
<line>Saue ba&#383;e authoritie from others Bookes.</line>
<line>The&#383;e earthly Godfathers of heauens lights,</line>
<line>That giue a name to euery fixed Starre,</line>
<line>Haue no more profit of their &#383;hining nights,</line>
<line>Then tho&#383;e that walke and wot not what they are.</line>
<line>Too much to know, is to know nought but fame:</line>
<line>And euery Godfather can giue a name.</line>
