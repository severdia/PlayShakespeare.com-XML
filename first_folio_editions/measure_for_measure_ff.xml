<line>Not light them for them&#383;elues: For if our vertues</line>

<line>The &#383;malle&#383;t &#383;cruple of her excellence,</line>

<line>As to your &#383;oule &#383;eemes good: Giue me your hand,</line>

<line>Who&#383;e creadit with the Iudge, or owne great place,</line>
<line>Could fetch your Brother from the Manacles</line>
<line>Of the all-building-Law: and that there were</line>
<line>No earthly meane to &#383;aue him, but that either</line>
<line>You mu&#383;t lay downe the trea&#383;ures of your body,</line>
<line>To this &#383;uppo&#383;ed, or el&#383;e to let him &#383;u&#64256;er:</line>
<line>What would you doe?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>I&#383;ab.</speaker>
<line>As much for my poore Brother, as my &#383;elfe;</line>
<line>That is: were I vnder the tearmes of death,</line>
<line>Th&#8217; impre&#383;&#383;ion of keene whips, I&#8217;ld weare as Rubies,</line>
<line>And &#383;trip my &#383;elfe to death, as to a bed,</line>

<line>My body vp to &#383;hame.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<line>Then mu&#383;t your brother die.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>I&#383;a.</speaker>
<line>And &#8217;twer the cheaper way:</line>
<line>Better it were a brother dide at once,</line>
<line>Then that a &#383;i&#383;ter, by redeeming him</line>
<line>Should die for euer.</line>
</speech>

<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<line>Were not you then as cruell as the Sentence,</line>

<line>Ignomie in ran&#383;ome, and free pardon</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ang.</speaker>
<line>You &#383;eem&#8217;d of late to make the Law a tirant,</line>
<line>And rather prou&#8217;d the &#383;liding of your brother</line>
<line>A merriment, then a vice.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>I&#383;a.</speaker>
<line>Oh pardon me my Lord, it oft fals out</line>

<line>Be ab&#383;olute for death: either death or life</line>
<line>Shall thereby be the &#383;weeter. Rea&#383;on thus with life:</line>
<line>If I do loo&#383;e thee, I do loo&#383;e a thing</line>
<line>That none but fooles would keepe: a breath thou art,</line>
<line>Seruile to all the skyie-in&#64258;uences</line>
<line>That do&#383;t this habitation where thou keep&#383;t</line>
<line>Hourely af&#64258;i&#392;t: Meerely, thou art deaths foole,</line>
<line>For him thou labour&#383;t by thy &#64258;ight to &#383;hun,</line>
<line>And yet run&#383;t toward him &#383;till. Thou art not noble,</line>
<line>For all th&#8217; accommodations that thou bear&#383;t,</line>
<line>Are nur&#383;t by ba&#383;ene&#383;&#383;e: Thou&#8217;rt by no meanes valiant,</line>

<line>Of a poore worme: thy be&#383;t of re&#383;t is &#383;leepe,</line>
<line>And that thou oft prouoak&#383;t, yet gro&#383;&#383;elie fear&#383;t</line>
<line>Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thy &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>For thou exi&#383;ts on manie a thou&#383;and graines</line>
<line>That i&#383;&#383;ue out of du&#383;t. Happie thou art not,</line>

<line>For thy complexion &#383;hifts to &#383;trange e&#64256;e&#392;ts,</line>
<line>After the Moone: If thou art rich, thou&#8217;rt poore,</line>

<line>Thou bear&#383;t thy heauie riches but a iournie,</line>

<line>The meere e&#64256;u&#383;ion of thy proper loines</line>
<line>Do cur&#383;e the Gowt, Sapego, and the Rheume</line>
<line>For ending thee no &#383;ooner. Thou ha&#383;t nor youth, nor age</line>
<line>But as it were an after-dinners &#383;leepe</line>
<line>Dreaming on both, for all thy ble&#383;&#383;ed youth</line>
<line>Becomes as aged, and doth begge the almes</line>

<line>Thou ha&#383;t neither heate, a&#64256;e&#392;tion, limbe, nor beautie</line>

<line>him well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>It was a mad fanta&#383;ticall tricke of him to &#383;teale</line>
<line>from the State, and v&#383;urpe the beggerie hee was neuer</line>
<line>borne to: Lord <nameref>Angelo</nameref> Dukes it well in his ab&#383;ence: he</line>

<line>He do&#8217;s well in&#8217;t.</line>

<line>A little more lenitie to Lecherie would doe no</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duk.</speaker>
<line>It is too general a vice, and &#383;eueritie mu&#383;t cure it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>Yes in good &#383;ooth, the vice is of a great kindred;</line>
<line>it is vvell allied, but it is impo&#383;&#383;ible to extirpe it quite,</line>
<line>Frier, till eating and drinking be put downe. They &#383;ay</line>
<line>this <nameref>Angelo</nameref> vvas not made by Man and Woman, after</line>

<line>you?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>How &#383;hould he be made then?</line>

<line>Some report, a Sea-maid &#383;pawn&#8217;d him. Some,</line>
<line>that he vvas begot betweene two Stock-&#64257;&#383;hes. But it</line>
<line>is certaine, that when he makes water, his Vrine is con-</line>
<line>geal&#8217;d ice, that I know to bee true: and he is a motion</line>
<line>generatiue, that&#8217;s infallible.</line>

<line>You are plea&#383;ant &#383;ir, and &#383;peake apace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Luc.</speaker>
<line>Why, what a ruthle&#383;&#383;e thing is this in him, for</line>
<line>the rebellion of a Cod-peece, to take away the life of a</line>
<line>man? Would the Duke that is ab&#383;ent haue done this?</line>
<line>Ere he vvould haue hang&#8217;d a man for the getting a hun-</line>
<line>dred Ba&#383;tards, he vvould haue paide for the Nur&#383;ing a</line>
<line>thou&#383;and. He had &#383;ome feeling of the &#383;port, hee knew</line>
<line>the &#383;eruice, and that in&#383;tru&#392;ted him to mercie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>I neuer heard the ab&#383;ent Duke much dete&#392;ted</line>

<line>and his v&#383;e was, to put a ducket in her Clack-di&#383;h; the</line>
<line>Duke had Crochets in him. Hee would be drunke too,</line>

<line>this <nameref>Claudio</nameref> is condemned for vntru&#383;&#383;ing. Farwell good</line>

<line>aged in any kinde of cour&#383;e, as it is vertuous to be con-</line>

<line>You haue paid the heauens your Fun&#392;tion, and</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>How came it, that the ab&#383;ent Duke had not</line>

<line>haue heard it was euer his manner to do &#383;o.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>His friends &#383;till wrought Repreeues for him:</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>A man that apprehends death no more dread-</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>He wants aduice.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>He wil heare none: he hath euermore had the li-</line>
<line>berty of the pri&#383;on: giue him leaue to e&#383;cape hence, hee</line>
<line>would not. Drunke many times a day, if not many daies</line>
<line>entirely drunke. We haue verie oft awak&#8217;d him, as if to</line>
<line>carrie him to execution, and &#383;hew&#8217;d him a &#383;eeming war-</line>
<line>rant for it, it hath not moued him at all.</line>

<line>truly, my ancient skill beguiles me: but in the boldnes</line>
<line>of my cunning, I will lay my &#383;elfe in hazard: <nameref>Claudio</nameref>,</line>
<line>whom heere you haue warrant to execute, is no greater</line>
<line>forfeit to the Law, then <nameref>Angelo</nameref> who hath &#383;entenc&#8217;d him.</line>
<line>To make you vnder&#383;tand this in a manife&#383;ted e&#64256;e&#392;t, I</line>
<line>craue but foure daies re&#383;pit: for the which, you are to</line>
<line>do me both a pre&#383;ent, and a dangerous courte&#383;ie.</line>
</speech>

<line>In the delaying death.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>Oh, death&#8217;s a great di&#383;gui&#383;er, and you may</line>
<line>adde to it; Shaue the head, and tie the beard, and &#383;ay it</line>
<line>was the de&#383;ire of the penitent to be &#383;o bar&#8217;de before his</line>
<line>death: you know the cour&#383;e is common. If any thing</line>
<line>fall to you vpon this, more then thankes and good for-</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pro.</speaker>
<line>But what likelihood is in that?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Duke.</speaker>
<line>Not a re&#383;emblance, but a certainty; yet &#383;ince</line>
<line>I &#383;ee you fearfull, that neither my coate, integrity, nor</line>
<line>per&#383;wa&#383;ion, can with ea&#383;e attempt you, I wil go further</line>

<line>of the Dukes death, perchance entering into &#383;ome Mo-</line>
