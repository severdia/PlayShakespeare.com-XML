<line>Horribly &#383;tufft with Epithites of warre,</line>

<line>Many a dutious and knee-crooking knaue;</line>
<line>That (doting on his owne ob&#383;equious bondage)</line>
<line>Weares out his time, much like his Ma&#383;ters A&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>For naught but Prouender, &#38; when he&#8217;s old Ca&#383;heer&#8217;d.</line>

<line>The natiue a&#392;t, and figure of my heart</line>
<line>In Complement externe, &#8216;tis not long after</line>

<line>Of Yeares, of Country, Credite, euery thing</line>
<line>To fall in Loue, with what &#383;he fear&#8217;d to looke on;</line>

<line>Of being taken by the In&#383;olent Foe,</line>

<line>Come hither Moore;</line>
<line>I here do giue thee that with all my heart,</line>
<line>Which but thou ha&#383;t already, with all my heart</line>
<line>I would keepe from thee. For your &#383;ake (Iewell)</line>
<line>I am glad at &#383;oule, I haue no other Child,</line>

<line>Let me &#383;peake like your &#383;elfe:</line>
<line>And lay a Sentence,</line>
<line>Which as a gri&#383;e, or &#383;tep may helpe the&#383;e Louers.</line>
<line>When remedies are pa&#383;t, the griefes are ended</line>
<line>By &#383;eeing the wor&#383;t, which late on hopes depended.</line>
<line>To mourne a Mi&#383;cheefe that is pa&#383;t and gon,</line>
<line>Is the next way to draw new mi&#383;chiefe on.</line>
<line>What cannot be pre&#383;eru&#8217;d, when Fortune takes:</line>
<line>Patience, her Iniury a mock&#8217;ry makes.</line>
<line>The rob&#8217;d that &#383;miles, &#383;teales &#383;omething from the Thiefe,</line>
<line>He robs him&#383;elfe, that &#383;pends a bootele&#383;&#383;e griefe.</line>

<line>So let the Turke of Cyprus vs beguile,</line>

<line>He beares the Sentence well, that nothing beares,</line>
<line>But the free comfort which from thence he heares.</line>
<line>But he beares both the Sentence, and the &#383;orrow,</line>
<line>That to pay griefe, mu&#383;t of poore Patience borrow.</line>
<line>The&#383;e Sentences, to Sugar, or to Gall,</line>
<line>Being &#383;trong on both &#383;ides, are Equiuocall.</line>
<line>But words are words, I neuer yet did heare:</line>

<line>betwixt a Benefit, and an Iniurie: I neuer found man that</line>

<line>Vertue? A figge, &#8216;tis in our &#383;elues that we are</line>
<line>thus, or thus. Our Bodies are our Gardens, to the which,</line>
<line>our Wills are Gardiners. So that if we will plant Net-</line>
<line>tels, or &#383;owe Lettice: Set Hi&#383;ope, and weede vp Time:</line>
<line>Supplie it with one gender of Hearbes, or di&#383;tra&#392;t it with</line>
<line>many: either to haue it &#383;terrill with idlene&#383;&#383;e, or manu-</line>
<line>red with Indu&#383;try, why the power, and Corrigeable au-</line>
<line>thoritie of this lies in our Wills. If the braine of our liues</line>
<line>had not one Scale of Rea&#383;on, to poize another of Sen&#383;u-</line>
<line>alitie, the blood, and ba&#383;ene&#383;&#383;e of our Natures would</line>

<line>haue Rea&#383;on to coole our raging Motions, our carnall</line>
<line>Stings, or vnbitted Lu&#383;ts: whereof I take this, that you</line>
<line>call Loue, to be a Se&#392;t, or Seyen.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rod.</speaker>
<line>It cannot be.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iago.</speaker>
<line>It is meerly a Lu&#383;t of the blood, and a permi&#383;&#383;ion</line>
<line>of the will. Come, be a man: drowne thy &#383;elfe? Drown</line>
<line>Cats, and blind Puppies. I haue profe&#383;t me thy Friend,</line>
<line>and I confe&#383;&#383;e me knit to thy de&#383;eruing, with Cables of</line>
<line>perdurable toughne&#383;&#383;e. I could neuer better &#383;teed thee</line>
<line>then now. Put Money in thy pur&#383;e: follow thou the</line>
<line>Warres, defeate thy fauour, with an v&#383;urp&#8217;d Beard. I &#383;ay</line>
<line>put Money in thy pur&#383;e. It cannot be long that <nameref>De&#383;demona</nameref></line>
<line>&#383;hould continue her loue to the Moore. Put Money in</line>
<line>thy pur&#383;e: nor he his to her. It was a violent Commence-</line>
<line>ment in her, and thou &#383;halt &#383;ee an an&#383;werable Seque-</line>
<line>&#383;tration, put but Money in thy pur&#383;e. The&#383;e Moores</line>
<line>are changeable in their wils: fill thy pur&#383;e with Money.</line>
<line>The Food that to him now is as lu&#383;hious as Locu&#383;ts,</line>
<line>&#383;halbe to him &#383;hortly, as bitter as Coloquintida. She</line>
<line>mu&#383;t change for youth: when &#383;he is &#383;ated with his body</line>
<line>&#383;he will find the errors of her choice. Therefore, put Mo-</line>
<line>ney in thy pur&#383;e. If thou wilt needs damne thy &#383;elfe, do</line>
<line>it a more delicate way then drowning. Make all the Mo-</line>
<line>ney thou can&#383;t: If San&#392;timonie, and a fraile vow, be-</line>
<line>twixt an erring Barbarian, and &#383;uper-&#383;ubtle Venetian be</line>
<line>not too hard for my wits, and all the Tribe of hell, thou</line>
<line>&#383;halt enioy her: therefore make Money: a pox of drow-</line>
<line>ning thy &#383;elfe, it is cleane out of the way. Seeke thou ra-</line>
<line>ther to be hang&#8217;d in Compa&#383;&#383;ing thy ioy, then to be</line>
<line>drown&#8217;d, and go without her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Wilt thou be fa&#383;t to my hopes, if I depend on</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Iago.</speaker>
<line>Thou art &#383;ure of me: Go make Money: I haue</line>
<line>told thee often, and I re-tell thee againe, and againe, I</line>
<line>hate the Moore. My cau&#383;e is hearted; thine hath no le&#383;&#383;e</line>
<line>rea&#383;on. Let vs be coniun&#392;tiue in our reuenge, again&#383;t</line>
<line>him. If thou can&#383;t Cuckold him, thou do&#383;t thy &#383;elfe a</line>
<line>plea&#383;ure, me a &#383;port. There are many Euents in the</line>
<line>Wombe of Time, which wilbe deliuered. Trauer&#383;e, go,</line>

<line>And <nameref>Ca&#383;&#383;io</nameref> following him with determin&#8217;d Sword</line>

<line>Out of his &#383;cattering, and vn&#383;ure ob&#383;eruance:</line>

<line>To let you know my thoughts.</line>

<line>Good name in Man, &#38; woman (deere my Lord)</line>

<speech>

<line>With fre&#383;h &#383;u&#383;pition&#383;? No: to be once in doubt,</line>

<line>To &#383;uch exufflicate, and blow&#8217;d Surmi&#383;es,</line>

<line>Nor from mine owne weake merites, will I draw</line>
<line>The &#383;malle&#383;t feare, or doubt of her reuolt,</line>

<line>And happily repent.</line>
</speech>

<line>Note if your Lady &#383;traine his Entertainment</line>
<line>With any &#383;trong, or vehement importunitie,</line>

<line>When they change vs for others? Is it Sport?</line>
<line>I thinke it is: and doth Affe&#392;tion breed it?</line>
<line>I thinke it doth. Is&#8217;t Frailty that thus erres?</line>
<line>It is &#383;o too. And haue not we Affe&#392;tions?</line>
