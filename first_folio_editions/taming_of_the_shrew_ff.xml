<line>Fie, fie, vnknit that threatning vnkinde brow,</line>
<line>And dart not &#383;cornefull glances from tho&#383;e eies,</line>
<line>To wound thy Lord, thy King, thy Gouernour.</line>
<line>It blots thy beautie, as fro&#383;ts d&#339; bite the Meads,</line>
<line>Confounds thy fame, as whirlewinds &#383;hake faire budds,</line>
<line>And in no &#383;ence is meete or amiable.</line>
<line>A woman mou&#8217;d, is like a fountaine troubled,</line>
<line>Muddie, ill &#383;eeming, thicke, bereft of beautie,</line>
<line>And while it is &#383;o, none &#383;o dry or thir&#383;tie</line>
<line>Will daigne to &#383;ip, or touch one drop of it.</line>
<line>Thy husband is thy Lord, thy life, thy keeper,</line>
<line>Thy head, thy &#383;oueraigne: One that cares for thee,</line>
<line>And for thy maintenance. Commits his body</line>
<line>To painfull labour, both by &#383;ea and land:</line>
<line>To watch the night in &#383;tormes, the day in cold,</line>
<line>Whil&#8217;&#383;t thou ly&#8217;&#383;t warme at home, &#383;ecure and &#383;afe,</line>
<line>And craues no other tribute at thy hands,</line>
<line>But loue, faire lookes, and true obedience;</line>
<line>Too little payment for &#383;o great a debt.</line>
<line>Such dutie as the &#383;ubie&#392;t owes the Prince,</line>
<line>Euen &#383;uch a woman oweth to her husband:</line>
<line>And when &#383;he is froward, peeui&#383;h, &#383;ullen, &#383;owre,</line>
<line>And not obedient to his hone&#383;t will,</line>
<line>What is &#383;he but a foule contending Rebell,</line>
<line>And gracele&#383;&#383;e Traitor to her louing Lord?</line>
<line>I am asham&#8217;d that women are &#383;o &#383;imple,</line>
<line>To offer warre, where they &#383;hould kneele for peace:</line>
<line>Or &#383;eeke for rule, &#383;upremacie, and &#383;way,</line>
<line>When they are bound to &#383;erue, loue, and obay.</line>
<line>Why are our bodies &#383;oft, and weake, and &#383;mooth,</line>
<line>Vnapt to toyle and trouble in the world,</line>
<line>But that our &#383;oft conditions, and our harts,</line>
<line>Should well agree with our externall parts?</line>
<line>Come, come, you froward and vnable wormes,</line>
<line>My minde hath bin as bigge as one of yours,</line>
<line>My heart as great, my rea&#383;on haplie more,</line>
<line>To bandie word for word, and frowne for frowne;</line>
<line>But now I &#383;ee our Launces are but &#383;trawes:</line>
<line>Our &#383;trength as weake, our weakene&#383;&#383;e pa&#383;t compare,</line>
<line>That &#383;eeming to be mo&#383;t, which we indeed lea&#383;t are.</line>
<line>Then vale your &#383;tomackes, for it is no boote,</line>
<line>And place your hands below your husbands foote:</line>
<line>In token of which dutie, if he plea&#383;e,</line>
<line>My hand is readie, may it do him ea&#383;e.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pet.</speaker>
<line>Why there&#8217;s a wench: Come on, and ki&#383;&#383;e mee</line>
