He hath spent that, and since hath borrowed, protested with oaths, alleged kindred to wring money from me, by the love I bore his father, by the fortunes might fall upon himself, to furnish his wants. That done, I have had since his bond, his friend, and friend&#8217;s bond although I know that he spends is yours, yet it grieves me to see the unbridled wildness that reigns over him.</l>

If they do not relish altogether of damnation, his youth may privilege his wantonness: I myself ran an unbridled course till thirty, nay almost till forty; well, you see how I am: for vice once looked into with the eyes of discretion, and well balanced with the weights of reason, the course past seems so abominable that the landlord of himself, which is the heart of his body, will rather entomb himself in the earth, or seek a new tenant to remain in him, which once settled, how much better are they that in their youth have known all these vices and left it, than those that knew little and in their age runs into it? Believe me, brother, they that die most virtuous hath in their youth lived most vicious, and none knows the danger of the fire more than he that falls into it. But say, how is the course of his life? Let&#8217;s hear his particulars.</l>
