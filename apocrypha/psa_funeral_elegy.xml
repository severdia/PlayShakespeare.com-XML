      <subtitle>TO MASTER JOHN PETER<lb/>of Bowhay in Devon, Esq.</subtitle>
      <l gn="1">The love I bore to your brother, and will do to his memory, hath crav&#8217;d from me this last duty of a friend; I am herein but a second to the privilege of Truth, who can warrant more in his behalf than I undertook to deliver. Exercise in this kind I will little affect, and am less addicted to, but there must be miracle in that labor which, to witness my remembrance to this departed gentleman, I would not willingly undergo. Yet whatsoever is here done, is done to him, and to him only. For whom and whose sake I will not forget to remember any friendly respects to you, or to any of those that have lov&#8217;d him for himself, and himself for his deserts.</l>

      <l gn="36" n="35" form="verse">Warrant enough in his own innocence</l>
      <l gn="37" n="36" form="verse">Against the sting of some in nature bad.</l>
      <l gn="38" n="37" form="verse">Yet who is he so absolutely blest</l>

      <l gn="46" n="45" form="verse">Whose very virtues are, not to detract</l>
      <l gn="47" n="46" form="verse">Whiles hope remains of gain (base fee of slaves),</l>

      <l gn="54" n="53" form="verse">Which, harvest-like, did yield again the crop</l>
      <l gn="55" n="54" form="verse">Of Education, better&#8217;d in his truth.</l>

      <l gn="57" n="56" form="verse">Learning and Wit, refined in their kind</l>
      <l gn="58" n="57" form="verse">Did jointly both, in their peculiar graces,</l>

      <l gn="60" n="59" form="verse">Indeed a temple, in whose precious white</l>
      <l gn="61" n="60" form="verse">Sat Reason by Religion oversway&#8217;d,</l>
      <l gn="62" n="61" form="verse">Teaching his other senses, with delight,</l>

      <l gn="64" n="63" form="verse">Not fruitlessly in prodigal expense</l>
      <l gn="65" n="64" form="verse">Wasting his best of time, but so content</l>
      <l gn="66" n="65" form="verse">With Reason&#8217;s golden Mean to make defense</l>
      <l gn="67" n="66" form="verse">Against the assault of youth&#8217;s encouragement;</l>
      <l gn="68" n="67" form="verse">As not the tide of this surrounding age</l>
      <l gn="69" n="68" form="verse">(When now his father&#8217;s death had freed his will)</l>
      <l gn="70" n="69" form="verse">Could make him subject to the drunken rage</l>
      <l gn="71" n="70" form="verse">Of such whose only glory is their ill.</l>
      <l gn="72" n="71" form="verse">He from the happy knowledge of the wise</l>
      <l gn="73" n="72" form="verse">Draws virtue to reprove secured fools</l>
      <l gn="74" n="73" form="verse">And shuns the glad sleights of ensnaring vice</l>
      <l gn="75" n="74" form="verse">To spend his spring of days in sacred schools.</l>
      <l gn="76" n="75" form="verse">Here gave he diet to the sick desires</l>
      <l gn="77" n="76" form="verse">That day by day assault the weaker man,</l>
      <l gn="78" n="77" form="verse">And with fit moderation still retires</l>
      <l gn="79" n="78" form="verse">From what doth batter virtue now and then.</l>
      <l gn="80" n="79" form="verse">But that I not intend in full discourse</l>
      <l gn="81" n="80" form="verse">To progress out his life, I could display</l>
      <l gn="82" n="81" form="verse">A good man in each part exact and force</l>
      <l gn="83" n="82" form="verse">The common voice to warrant what I say.</l>
      <l gn="84" n="83" form="verse">For if his fate and heaven had decreed</l>
      <l gn="85" n="84" form="verse">That full of days he might have liv&#8217;d to see</l>
      <l gn="86" n="85" form="verse">The grave in peace, the times that should succeed</l>
      <l gn="87" n="86" form="verse">Had been best-speaking witnesses with me;</l>
      <l gn="88" n="87" form="verse">Whose conversation so untouch&#8217;d did move</l>
      <l gn="89" n="88" form="verse">Respect most in itself, as who would scan</l>
      <l gn="90" n="89" form="verse">His honesty and worth, by them might prove</l>
      <l gn="91" n="90" form="verse">He was a kind, true, perfect gentleman&#8212;</l>
      <l gn="92" n="91" form="verse">Not in the outside of disgraceful folly,</l>
      <l gn="93" n="92" form="verse">Courting opinion with unfit disguise,</l>
      <l gn="94" n="93" form="verse">Affecting fashions, nor addicted wholly</l>
      <l gn="95" n="94" form="verse">To unbeseeming blushless vanities,</l>

      <l gn="97" n="96" rend="indent(2)" form="verse">As that his Virtue was his best Attire.</l>
      <l gn="98" n="97" form="verse">Not in the waste of many idle words</l>
      <l gn="99" n="98" form="verse">Car&#8217;d he to be heard talk, nor in the float</l>
      <l gn="100" n="99" form="verse">Of fond conceit, such as this age affords,</l>
      <l gn="101" n="100" form="verse">By vain discourse upon himself to dote;</l>
      <l gn="102" n="101" form="verse">For his becoming silence gave such grace</l>
      <l gn="103" n="102" form="verse">To his judicious parts, as what he spake</l>
      <l gn="104" n="103" form="verse">Seem&#8217;d rather answers which the wise embrace</l>
      <l gn="105" n="104" form="verse">Than busy questions such as talkers make.</l>
      <l gn="106" n="105" form="verse">And though his qualities might well deserve</l>

      <l gn="108" n="107" form="verse">Such harmony of goodness did preserve</l>
      <l gn="109" n="108" form="verse">As nature never built in better kind;</l>
      <l gn="110" n="109" form="verse">Knowing the best, and therefore not presuming</l>
      <l gn="111" n="110" form="verse">In knowing, but for that it was the best,</l>
      <l gn="112" n="111" form="verse">Ever within himself free choice resuming</l>
      <l gn="113" n="112" form="verse">Of true perfection, in a perfect breast;</l>
      <l gn="114" n="113" form="verse">So that his mind and body made an inn,</l>

      <l gn="116" n="115" form="verse">For fair conditions, guests that soonest win</l>

      <l gn="119" n="118" form="verse">Endeavors, modest speech, beseeming mirth,</l>
      <l gn="120" n="119" form="verse">True friendship, active grace, persuasion sweet,</l>
      <l gn="121" n="120" form="verse">Delightful love innated from his birth,</l>
      <l gn="122" n="121" form="verse">Acquaintance unfamiliar, carriage just,</l>

      <l gn="125" n="124" form="verse">Unburthen&#8217;d conscience, unfeign&#8217;d piety;</l>
      <l gn="126" n="125" form="verse">If these, or all of these, knit fast in one</l>
      <l gn="127" n="126" form="verse">Can merit praise, then justly may we say,</l>
      <l gn="128" n="127" form="verse">Not any from this frailer stage is gone</l>

      <l gn="524" n="523" form="verse">Such was the separation here constrain&#8217;d</l>
      <l gn="525" n="524" form="verse">(Well-worthy to be termed a rudeness rather),</l>
