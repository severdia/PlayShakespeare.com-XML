  <!-- 

From humble beginnings, Thomas Cromwell, a smith&#38;#8217;s son, rises to power and prominence in Tudor England. The self-educated Cromwell&#38;#8217;s industry and integrity see him promoted to the post of clerk in Antwerp, where he helps foil the villainous attempts of a broker, Bagot, to ruin the merchant Banister. Travelling in Europe with his servant, Hodge, he is robbed by bandits but relieved by the good-hearted Frescobald, and then advances himself by securing the freedom of the Earl of Bedford, who is imprisoned in Bologna. Back in London, Cardinal Wolsey takes an interest in the young man and employs him. Following the deaths of Wolsey and Thomas More, Cromwell is appointed Keeper of the Privy Seal, in which position he is able to reward those who have previously helped him. The jealous Gardiner, however, secures Cromwell&#38;#8217;s downfall on false charges of treason, despite Bedford&#38;#8217;s attempts to help him. Cromwell is arrested, imprisoned and executed, to the absent king&#38;#8217;s regret.

They all swore I told them as right as if I had been acquainted with the carpenter that made it. At last we grew near land, and I grew villainous hungry, went to my bag: the devil a bit there was. The sailors had tickled me: yet I cannot blame them: it was a part of kindness, for I in kindness told them what wood the ship was made of, and they in kindness eat up my victuals, as indeed one good turn asketh another.
