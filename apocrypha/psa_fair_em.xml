Amongst the which, when the music began to sound the measures, each masker made choice of his lady. And one, more forward than the rest, stepped towards thee, which I perceiving, thrust him aside and took thee myself. But this was taken in so ill part, that at my coming out of the court gate, with justling together it was my chance to be thrust into the arm. The doer thereof, because he was the original cause of the disorder at that inconvenient time, was presently committed, and is this morning sent for to answer the matter. And I think here he comes.

That enticing speeches should not beguile me, I have made myself deaf to any but to him; and lest any man&#8217;s person should please me more than his, I have dissembled the want of my sight. Both which shadows of my irrevocable affections I have not spared to confirm before him, my father, and all other amorous solicitors; wherewith not made acquainted, I perceive my true intent hath wrought mine own sorrow, and seeking by love to be regarded, am cut off with contempt, and despised.</l>
