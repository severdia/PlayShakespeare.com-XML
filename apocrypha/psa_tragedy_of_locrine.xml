Following the Senecan model of revenge tragedy, each of the play&#38;#8217;s five acts is preceded by a Prologue that features Atë, the ancient Greek goddess of folly and ruin. In each, At&#38;#233; introduces and explicates a dumbshow; the play&#38;#8217;s five dumbshows feature symbolic figures and animals, or personages of classical mythology. In the first, an archer kills a lion; the second shows Perseus and Andromeda, and the third, a snake stinging a crocodile. The fourth dumbshow features Hercules and Omphale; the final dumbshow depicts Medea&#38;#8217;s murder of Jason and Glauce. At&#38;#233; returns for a sixth and final appearance at the play&#38;#8217;s conclusion.

The opening scene of the play proper shows the aged Brutus, the leader of the Trojans in Britain, before his courtiers, including his three sons, Locrine, Albanact and Camber. Brutus knows he is dying, and attempts to order the kingdom&#38;#8217;s affairs; among other points, he decrees that Locrine marry Gwendolyn, the daughter of his loyal general Corineus. The scene ends with Brutus&#38;#8217;s death. Locrine obeys his father&#38;#8217;s behest and marries Gwendolyn.

Meanwhile, the invading Scythians arrive for their incursion into the British Isles, led by their king Humber, with his wife Estrild and their son Hubba. Subsequent scenes depict a back-and-forth combat between Trojans and Scythians. When his apparent victory turns to sudden defeat, the Trojan prince Albanact commits suicide; Albanact&#38;#8217;s ghost appears through the remainder of the play, calling for revenge. The Trojans are eventually victorious. Estrild, the Scythian queen, is captured and brought to the Trojan court, where Locrine quickly falls in love with her. Corineus warns his royal son-in-law to remain faithful to Guendoline. Locrine does not follow this advice, though he sequesters Estrild in a subterranean hideaway for seven years. Once Corineus dies, Locrine brings his affair into the open; Gwendolyn&#38;#8217;s brother Thrasimachus vows revenge.

The defeated Humber has been living in seclusion and grinding privation for seven years since his defeat; when he kills himself, the ghost of Albanact exults. Corineus&#38;#8217;s ghost also appears to witness Locrine&#38;#8217;s fate; defeated in battle by the forces of Gwendolyn and Thrasimachus, Locrine and Estrild commit suicide, and their daughter Sabren eventually drowns herself. Guendoline has her husband buried royally, next to his father, but consigns Estrild to an obscure grave.

The play&#38;#8217;s comic relief is provided by a coterie of clown characters, Strumbo, Trompart, and Dorothy. Strumbo the cobbler marries Dorothy, but is impressed into the army along with his servant Trompart, to fight the Scythians. Strumbo survives battle by counterfeiting death:

Trompart: Yet one word, good master.
Strumbo: I will not speak, for I am dead, I tell thee.

Later Strumbo has an encounter with Humber, just before the latter&#38;#8217;s suicide. Strumbo is prepared to feed the starving Humber, but is frightened away by Albanact&#38;#8217;s ghost.

I&#8217;faith I have scaped many a scouring this year, but I thank God I have passed them all with a good coraggio, coraggio, and my wife and I are in great love and charity now, I thank my manhood and my strength. For I will tell you, masters, upon a certain day at night I came home, to say the very truth, with my stomach full of wine, and ran up into the chamber, where my wife soberly sat rocking my little baby, leaning her back against the bed, singing lullaby. Now when she saw me come with my nose foremost, thinking that I been drunk, as I was indeed, snatched up a faggot-stick in her hand, and came furiously marching towards me with a big face, as though she would have eaten me at a bit: thundering out these words unto me, &#8216;Thou, drunken knave, where hast thou been so long? I shall teach thee how to benight me another time!&#8217; and so she began to play knaves trumps. Now although I trembled fearing she would set her ten commandments in my face, ran within her, and taking her lustily by the middle, I carried her valiantly to the bed, and flinging her upon it, flung myself upon her, and there I delighted her so with the sport I made, that ever after she would call me &#8216;sweet husband&#8217;, and so banished brawling forever: and to see the good will of the wench; she bought with her portion a yard of land, and by that I am now become one of the richest men in our parish. Well, masters, what&#8217;s a clock? It is now breakfast time, you shall see what meat I have here for my breakfast.</l>
