I&#8217;ll speak a proud word: I have but one parsonage, Wrotham; &#8216;tis better than the Bishopric of Rochester. There&#8217;s ne&#8217;er a hill, heath, nor down in all Kent, but &#8216;tis in my parish: Barham down, Chobham down, Gad&#8217;s Hill, Wrotham hill, Black heath, Cock&#8217;s heath, Birchen wood, all pay me tithe. Gold, quotha? You pass not for that.</l>
