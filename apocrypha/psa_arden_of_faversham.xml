Ah, Mistress Susan, abolish that paltry painter: cut him off by the shins with a frowning look of your crabbed countenance and think upon Michael, who, drunk with the dregs of your favor, will cleave as fast to your love, as a plaster of pitch to a galled horseback. Thus hoping you will let my passions penetrate, or rather impetrate mercy of your meek hands, I end.</recite>

The bawdy houses have paid me tribute: there durst not a whore set up, unless she have agreed with me first, for opening her shop windows. For a cross word of a tapster, I have pierced one barrel after another, with my dagger, and held him by the ears till all his beer hath run out. In Thames Street, a brewer&#8217;s cart was like to have run over me, I made no more ado, but went to the clerk and cut all the notches off his tallies, and beat them about his head. I and my company have taken the constable from his watch and carried him about the fields on a coltstaff. I have broken a sergeant&#8217;s head with his own mace and bailed whom I list with my sword and buckler. All the tenpenny ale-houses would stand every morning, with a quart pot in his hand, saying, &#8220;Will it please your worship drink?&#8221; He that had not done so had been sure to have had his sign pulled down, and his lattice borne away the next night. To conclude, what have I not done? Yet cannot do this? Doubtless he is preserved by miracle.</l>

He, like a fool, bears his sword point half a yard out of danger, I lie here for my life. If the devil come and he have no more strength than sense, he shall never beat me from this ward, I&#8217;ll stand to it, a buckler in a skillful hand is as good as a castle.
