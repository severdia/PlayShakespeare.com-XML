But whatsoever I have merited, either in my mind or in my means, meed I am sure I have receiv&#8217;d none, unless experience be a jewel&#8212;that I have purchas&#8217;d at an infinite rate, and that hath taught me to say this:</l>

<speaker long="Francis Ford" alias="BRO.">FORD.</speaker>
<l gn="447" n="82" form="prose">O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on the excellency of her honor, that the folly of my soul dares not present itself; she is too bright to be look&#8217;d against. Now, could I come to her with any detection in my hand, my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves. I could drive her then from the ward of her purity, her reputation, her marriage vow, and a thousand other her defenses, which now are too too strongly embattled against me.

My wife hath sent to him, the hour is fix&#8217;d, the match is made. Would any man have thought this? See the hell of having a false woman! My bed shall be abus&#8217;d, my coffers ransack&#8217;d, my reputation gnawn at, and I shall not only receive this villainous wrong, but stand under the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that does me this wrong. Terms! Names! Amaimon sounds well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are devils&#8217; additions, the names of fiends; but Cuckold! Wittol!&#8212;Cuckold! The devil himself hath not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass; he will trust his wife, he will not be jealous. I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling gelding, than my wife with herself. Then she plots, then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they think in their hearts they may effect, they will break their hearts but they will effect. God be prais&#8217;d for my jealousy! Eleven o&#8217;clock the hour. I will prevent this, detect my wife, be reveng&#8217;d on Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it; better three hours too soon than a minute too late.

<l gn="815" n="40" form="prose">Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have suffer&#8217;d to bring this woman to evil for your good. Being thus cramm&#8217;d in the basket, a couple of Ford&#8217;s knaves, his hinds, were call&#8217;d forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet-lane. They took me on their shoulders; met the jealous knave their master in the door, who ask&#8217;d them once or twice what they had in their basket. I quak&#8217;d for fear, lest the lunatic knave would have search&#8217;d it; but fate (ordaining he should be a cuckold) held his hand. Well, on went he for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master Brook. I suffer&#8217;d the pangs of three several deaths: first, an intolerable fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten bell-wether; next, to be compass&#8217;d like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck, hilt to point, heel to head; and then to be stopp&#8217;d in like a strong distillation with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease. Think of that&#8212;a man of my kidney. Think of that&#8212;that am as subject to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw. It was a miracle to scape suffocation. And in the height of this bath (when I was more than half stew&#8217;d in grease, like a Dutch dish) to be thrown into the Thames, and cool&#8217;d, glowing-hot, in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of that&#8212;hissing-hot&#8212;think of that, Master Brook.</l>
