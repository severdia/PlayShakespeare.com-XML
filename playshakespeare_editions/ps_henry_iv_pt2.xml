The brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to invent any thing that intends to laughter more than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelm&#8217;d all her litter but one. If the Prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off, why then I have no judgment. Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never mann&#8217;d with an agot till now, but I will inset you neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and send you back again to your master for a jewel&#8212;the juvenal, the Prince your master, whose chin is not yet fledge. I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one of his cheek, and yet he will not stick to say his face is a face royal. God may finish it when he will, &#8217;tis not a hair amiss yet. He may keep it still at a face royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it; and yet he&#8217;ll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He may keep his own grace, but he&#8217;s almost out of mine, I can assure him. What said Master Dommelton about the satin for my short cloak and my slops?</l>

I had as live they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security. I look&#8217;d &#8217;a should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin (as I am a true knight), and he sends me security!

<l gn="340" n="1" form="verse">Thus have you heard our cause and known our means,</l>
<l gn="341" n="2" form="verse">And, my most noble friends, I pray you all</l>
<l gn="342" n="3" form="verse">Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes.</l>
<l gn="343" n="4" form="verse">And first, Lord Marshal, what say you to it?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Lord Mowbray">MOWB.</speaker>
<l gn="344" n="5" form="verse">I well allow the occasion of our arms,</l>
<l gn="345" n="6" form="verse">But gladly would be better satisfied</l>
<l gn="346" n="7" form="verse">How in our means we should advance ourselves</l>
<l gn="347" n="8" form="verse">To look with forehead bold and big enough</l>
<l gn="348" n="9" form="verse">Upon the power and puissance of the King.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Lord Hastings">HAST.</speaker>
<l gn="349" n="10" form="verse">Our present musters grow upon the file</l>
<l gn="350" n="11" form="verse">To five and twenty thousand men of choice,</l>
<l gn="351" n="12" form="verse">And our supplies live largely in the hope</l>
<l gn="352" n="13" form="verse">Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Lord Bardolph">L. BARD.</speaker>
<l gn="354" n="15" form="verse">The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus:</l>
<l gn="355" n="16" form="verse">Whether our present five and twenty thousand</l>
<l gn="356" n="17" form="verse">May hold up head without Northumberland?</l>
</sp>

<l gn="357" n="18" form="verse">With him, we may.</l>

<l gn="358" n="18" form="verse" rend="indent(4)">Yea, marry, there&#8217;s the point!</l>
<l gn="359" n="19" form="verse">But if without him we be thought too feeble,</l>
<l gn="360" n="20" form="verse">My judgment is we should not step too far</l>
<l gn="361" n="21" form="verse">Till we had his assistance by the hand.</l>
<l gn="362" n="22" form="verse">For in a theme so bloody-fac&#8217;d as this,</l>
<l gn="363" n="23" form="verse">Conjecture, expectation, and surmise</l>
<l gn="364" n="24" form="verse">Of aids incertain should not be admitted.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Richard Scroop, Archbishop of York">ARCH.</speaker>
<l gn="365" n="25" form="verse">&#8217;Tis very true, Lord Bardolph, for indeed</l>
<l gn="366" n="26" form="verse">It was young Hotspur&#8217;s cause at Shrewsbury.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Lord Bardolph">L. BARD.</speaker>
<l gn="367" n="27" form="verse">It was, my lord, who lin&#8217;d himself with hope,</l>
<l gn="368" n="28" form="verse">Eating the air, and promise of supply,</l>
<l gn="369" n="29" form="verse">Flatt&#8217;ring himself in project of a power</l>
<l gn="370" n="30" form="verse">Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts,</l>
<l gn="371" n="31" form="verse">And so with great imagination,</l>
<l gn="372" n="32" form="verse">Proper to madmen, led his powers to death,</l>
<l gn="373" n="33" form="verse">And winking, leapt into destruction.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Lord Hastings">HAST.</speaker>
<l gn="374" n="34" form="verse">But by your leave, it never yet did hurt</l>
<l gn="375" n="35" form="verse">To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Lord Bardolph">L. BARD.</speaker>
<l gn="376" n="36" form="verse">Yes, if this present quality of war&#8288;&#8212;</l>
<l gn="377" n="37" form="verse">Indeed the instant action, a cause on foot&#8288;&#8212;</l>
<l gn="378" n="38" form="verse">Lives so in hope, as in an early spring</l>
<l gn="379" n="39" form="verse">We see th&#8217; appearing buds, which to prove fruit</l>
<l gn="380" n="40" form="verse">Hope gives not so much warrant, as despair</l>
<l gn="381" n="41" form="verse">That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,</l>
<l gn="382" n="42" form="verse">We first survey the plot, then draw the model,</l>
<l gn="383" n="43" form="verse">And when we see the figure of the house,</l>
<l gn="384" n="44" form="verse">Then must we rate the cost of the erection,</l>
<l gn="385" n="45" form="verse">Which if we find outweighs ability,</l>
<l gn="386" n="46" form="verse">What do we then but draw anew the model</l>
<l gn="387" n="47" form="verse">In fewer offices, or at least desist</l>
<l gn="388" n="48" form="verse">To build at all? Much more, in this great work</l>
<l gn="389" n="49" form="verse">(Which is, almost, to pluck a kingdom down</l>
<l gn="390" n="50" form="verse">And set another up), should we survey</l>
<l gn="391" n="51" form="verse">The plot of situation and the model,</l>
<l gn="392" n="52" form="verse">Consent upon a sure foundation,</l>
<l gn="393" n="53" form="verse">Question surveyors, know our own estate,</l>
<l gn="394" n="54" form="verse">How able such a work to undergo,</l>
<l gn="395" n="55" form="verse">To weigh against his opposite; or else</l>
<l gn="396" n="56" form="verse">We fortify in paper and in figures,</l>
<l gn="397" n="57" form="verse">Using the names of men in stead of men,</l>
<l gn="398" n="58" form="verse">Like one that draws the model of an house</l>
<l gn="399" n="59" form="verse">Beyond his power to build it, who, half thorough,</l>
<l gn="400" n="60" form="verse">Gives o&#8217;er, and leaves his part-created cost</l>
<l gn="401" n="61" form="verse">A naked subject to the weeping clouds</l>
<l gn="402" n="62" form="verse">And waste for churlish winter&#8217;s tyranny.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Lord Hastings">HAST.</speaker>
<l gn="403" n="63" form="verse">Grant that our hopes (yet likely of fair birth)</l>

<l gn="405" n="65" form="verse">The utmost man of expectation,</l>

<l gn="412" n="72" form="verse">And one against Glendower; perforce a third</l>
<l gn="413" n="73" form="verse">Must take up us. So is the unfirm King</l>

But indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name, or to know thy face tomorrow, or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast, viz, these, and those that were thy peach-color&#8217;d once, or to bear the inventory of thy shirts, as one for superfluity, and another for use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better than I, for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done a great while, because the rest of the low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland. And God knows whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the midwives say the children are not in the fault, whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are mightily strengthen&#8217;d.</l>

Give me the spirit, Master Shallow. Here&#8217;s Wart, you see what a ragged appearance it is. &#8217;A shall charge you and discharge you with the motion of a pewterer&#8217;s hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets on the brewer&#8217;s bucket. And this same half-fac&#8217;d fellow, Shadow, give me this man. He presents no mark to the enemy, the foeman may with as great aim level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat, how swiftly will this Feeble the woman&#8217;s tailor run off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart&#8217;s hand, Bardolph.</l>

This same starv&#8217;d justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street, and every third word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk&#8217;s tribute. I do remember him at Clement&#8217;s Inn, like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring. When &#8217;a was naked, he was for all the world like a fork&#8217;d redish, with a head fantastically carv&#8217;d upon it with a knife. &#8217;A was so forlorn, that his dimensions to any thick sight were invisible. &#8217;A was the very genius of famine, yet lecherous as a monkey, and the whores call&#8217;d him mandrake. &#8217;A came ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those tunes to the overscutch&#8217;d huswives that he heard the carmen whistle, and sware they were his fancies or his good-nights. And now is this Vice&#8217;s dagger become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a&#8217; Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him, and I&#8217;ll be sworn &#8217;a ne&#8217;er saw him but once in the Tilt-yard, and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal&#8217;s men. I saw it, and told John a&#8217; Gaunt he beat his own name, for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin. The case of a treble hoboy was a mansion for him, a court, and now has he land and beefs! Well, I&#8217;ll be acquainted with him if I return, and&#8217;t shall go hard but I&#8217;ll make him a philosopher&#8217;s two stones to me. If the young dace be a bait for the old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him: let time shape, and there an end.</l>

<l gn="1496" n="42" form="prose">I would you had the wit, &#8217;twere better than your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy doth not love me, nor a man cannot make him laugh, but that&#8217;s no marvel, he drinks no wine. There&#8217;s never none of these demure boys come to any proof, for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood, and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness, and then when they marry, they get wenches. They are generally fools and cowards, which some of us should be too, but for inflammation. A good sherris-sack hath a twofold operation in it. It ascends me into the brain, dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapors which environ it, makes it apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and delectable shapes, which deliver&#8217;d o&#8217;er to the voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood, which before (cold and settled) left the liver white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice; but the sherris warms it, and makes it course from the inwards to the parts&#8217; extremes. It illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm, and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain, the heart, who great and puff&#8217;d up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valor comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack (for that sets it a-work) and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till sack commences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant, for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father, he hath, like lean, sterile, and bare land, manur&#8217;d, husbanded, and till&#8217;d with excellent endeavor of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I would teach them should be, to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack.</l>

They, by observing him, do bear themselves like foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is turn&#8217;d into a justice-like servingman. Their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent, like so many wild geese. If I had a suit to Master Shallow, I would humor his men with the imputation of being near their master; if to his men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man could better command his servants. It is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of another; therefore let men take heed of their company. I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two actions, and &#8217;a shall laugh without intervallums. O, it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders!

<l gn="2247" n="1" form="prose">First my fear, then my cur&#8217;sy, last my speech. My fear, is your displeasure, my cur&#8217;sy, my duty, and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look for a good speech now, you undo me, for what I have to say is of mine own making, and what indeed (I should say) will (I doubt) prove mine own marring. But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better. I meant indeed to pay you with this, which if like an ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promis&#8217;d you I would be, and here I commit my body to your mercies. Bate me some, and I will pay you some, and (as most debtors do) promise you infinitely; and so I kneel down before you&#8212;but, indeed, to pray for the Queen.</l>
<l gn="2248" n="2" form="prose">If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you command me to use my legs? And yet that were but light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a good conscience will make any possible satisfaction, and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have forgiven me; if the gentlemen will not, then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which was never seen in such an assembly.</l>
<l gn="2249" n="3" form="prose">One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too much cloy&#8217;d with fat meat, our humble author will continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make you merry with fair Katherine of France, where (for any thing I know) Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless already &#8217;a be kill&#8217;d with your hard opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the man. My tongue is weary, when my legs are too, I will bid you good night.</l>
