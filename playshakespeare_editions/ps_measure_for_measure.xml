</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Lucio">LUCIO.</speaker>
<l gn="1247" n="48" form="prose">It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he puts transgression to&#8217;t.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Vincentio, the Duke" alias="FRI.">DUKE.</speaker>
<l gn="1248" n="49" form="prose">He does well in&#8217;t.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Lucio">LUCIO.</speaker>
<l gn="1249" n="50" form="prose">A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him. Something too crabbed that way, friar.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Vincentio, the Duke" alias="FRI.">DUKE.</speaker>
<l gn="1250" n="51" form="prose">It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Lucio">LUCIO.</speaker>
<l gn="1251" n="52" form="prose">Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is well allied; but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation. Is it true, think you?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Vincentio, the Duke" alias="FRI.">DUKE.</speaker>
<l gn="1252" n="53" form="prose">How should he be made then?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Lucio">LUCIO.</speaker>
<l gn="1253" n="54" form="prose">Some report a sea-maid spawn&#8217;d him; some, that he was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congeal&#8217;d ice, that I know to be true; and he is a motion generative, that&#8217;s infallible.</l>

<speaker long="Lucio">LUCIO.</speaker>
<l gn="1255" n="56" form="prose">Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man! Would the Duke that is absent have done this? Ere he would have hang&#8217;d a man for the getting a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a thousand. He had some feeling of the sport; he knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.</l>
</sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Lucio">LUCIO.</speaker>
<l gn="1263" n="64" form="prose">No, pardon; &#8217;tis a secret must be lock&#8217;d within the teeth and the lips. But this I can let you understand, the greater file of the subject held the Duke to be wise.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Vincentio, the Duke">DUKE.</speaker>

<l gn="1266" n="67" form="prose">Either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking.

Let him be but testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the envious a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier. Therefore you speak unskillfully; or, if your knowledge be more, it is much dark&#8217;ned in your malice.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Lucio">LUCIO.</speaker>
<l gn="1277" n="78" form="prose">Why? For filling a bottle with a tun-dish. I would the Duke we talk of were return&#8217;d again. This ungenitur&#8217;d agent will unpeople the province with continency. Sparrows must not build in his house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The Duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answer&#8217;d, he would never bring them to light. Would he were return&#8217;d! Marry, this Claudio is condemn&#8217;d for untrussing. Farewell, good friar, I prithee pray for me. The Duke (I say to thee again) would eat mutton on Fridays. He&#8217;s now past it, yet (and I say to thee) he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so. Farewell.</l>

Look, th&#8217; unfolding star calls up the shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be; all difficulties are but easy when they are known. Call your executioner, and off with Barnardine&#8217;s head. I will give him a present shrift, and advise him for a better place. Yet you are amaz&#8217;d, but this shall absolutely resolve you.
