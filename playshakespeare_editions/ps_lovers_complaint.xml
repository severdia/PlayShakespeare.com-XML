<stanza num="1">
<l gn="1" n="1" rhyme="a" form="verse">From off a hill whose concave womb reworded</l>
<l gn="2" n="2" rhyme="b" form="verse">A plaintful story from a sist&#8217;ring vale,</l>
<l gn="3" n="3" rhyme="a" form="verse">My spirits t&#8217; attend this double voice accorded,</l>
<l gn="4" n="4" rhyme="b" form="verse">And down I laid to list the sad-tun&#8217;d tale,</l>
<l gn="5" n="5" rhyme="b" form="verse">Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale</l>
<l gn="6" n="6" rhyme="c" form="verse">Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,</l>
<l gn="7" n="7" rhyme="c" form="verse">Storming her world with sorrow&#8217;s wind and rain.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="2">
<l gn="8" n="8" rhyme="a" form="verse">Upon her head a platted hive of straw,</l>
<l gn="9" n="9" rhyme="b" form="verse">Which fortified her visage from the sun,</l>
<l gn="10" n="10" rhyme="a" form="verse">Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw</l>
<l gn="11" n="11" rhyme="b" form="verse">The carcass of a beauty spent and done.</l>
<l gn="12" n="12" rhyme="b" form="verse">Time had not scythed all that youth begun,</l>
<l gn="13" n="13" rhyme="c" form="verse">Nor youth all quit, but spite of heaven&#8217;s fell rage,</l>
<l gn="14" n="14" rhyme="c" form="verse">Some beauty peep&#8217;d through lattice of sear&#8217;d age.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="3">
<l gn="15" n="15" rhyme="a" form="verse">Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,</l>
<l gn="16" n="16" rhyme="b" form="verse">Which on it had conceited characters,</l>
<l gn="17" n="17" rhyme="a" form="verse">Laund&#8217;ring the silken figures in the brine</l>
<l gn="18" n="18" rhyme="b" form="verse">That seasoned woe had pelleted in tears,</l>
<l gn="19" n="19" rhyme="b" form="verse">And often reading what contents it bears;</l>
<l gn="20" n="20" rhyme="c" form="verse">As often shrieking undistinguish&#8217;d woe,</l>
<l gn="21" n="21" rhyme="c" form="verse">In clamors of all size, both high and low.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="4">
<l gn="22" n="22" rhyme="a" form="verse">Sometimes her levell&#8217;d eyes their carriage ride,</l>
<l gn="23" n="23" rhyme="b" form="verse">As they did batt&#8217;ry to the spheres intend;</l>
<l gn="24" n="24" rhyme="a" form="verse">Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied</l>
<l gn="25" n="25" rhyme="b" form="verse">To th&#8217; orbed earth; sometimes they do extend</l>
<l gn="26" n="26" rhyme="b" form="verse">Their view right on; anon their gazes lend</l>
<l gn="27" n="27" rhyme="c" form="verse">To every place at once, and no where fix&#8217;d,</l>
<l gn="28" n="28" rhyme="c" form="verse">The mind and sight distractedly commix&#8217;d.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="5">
<l gn="29" n="29" rhyme="a" form="verse">Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,</l>
<l gn="30" n="30" rhyme="b" form="verse">Proclaim&#8217;d in her a careless hand of pride;</l>
<l gn="31" n="31" rhyme="a" form="verse">For some untuck&#8217;d descended her sheav&#8217;d hat,</l>
<l gn="32" n="32" rhyme="b" form="verse">Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;</l>
<l gn="33" n="33" rhyme="b" form="verse">Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,</l>
<l gn="34" n="34" rhyme="c" form="verse">And true to bondage would not break from thence,</l>
<l gn="35" n="35" rhyme="c" form="verse">Though slackly braided in loose negligence.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="6">
<l gn="36" n="36" rhyme="a" form="verse">A thousand favors from a maund she drew,</l>
<l gn="37" n="37" rhyme="b" form="verse">Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,</l>
<l gn="38" n="38" rhyme="a" form="verse">Which one by one she in a river threw,</l>
<l gn="39" n="39" rhyme="b" form="verse">Upon whose weeping margent she was set,</l>
<l gn="40" n="40" rhyme="b" form="verse">Like usury applying wet to wet,</l>
<l gn="41" n="41" rhyme="c" form="verse">Or monarch&#8217;s hands that lets not bounty fall</l>
<l gn="42" n="42" rhyme="c" form="verse">Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="7">
<l gn="43" n="43" rhyme="a" form="verse">Of folded schedules had she many a one,</l>
<l gn="44" n="44" rhyme="b" form="verse">Which she perus&#8217;d, sigh&#8217;d, tore, and gave the flood,</l>
<l gn="45" n="45" rhyme="a" form="verse">Crack&#8217;d many a ring of posied gold and bone,</l>
<l gn="46" n="46" rhyme="b" form="verse">Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud,</l>
<l gn="47" n="47" rhyme="b" form="verse">Found yet more letters sadly penn&#8217;d in blood,</l>
<l gn="48" n="48" rhyme="c" form="verse">With sleided silk feat and affectedly</l>
<l gn="49" n="49" rhyme="c" form="verse">Enswath&#8217;d and seal&#8217;d to curious secrecy.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="8">
<l gn="50" n="50" rhyme="a" form="verse">These often bath&#8217;d she in her fluxive eyes,</l>
<l gn="51" n="51" rhyme="b" form="verse">And often kiss&#8217;d, and often gan to tear;</l>
<l gn="52" n="52" rhyme="a" form="verse">Cried, &#8220;O false blood, thou register of lies,</l>
<l gn="53" n="53" rhyme="b" form="verse">What unapproved witness dost thou bear!</l>
<l gn="54" n="54" rhyme="b" form="verse">Ink would have seem&#8217;d more black and damned here!&#8221;</l>
<l gn="55" n="55" rhyme="c" form="verse">This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,</l>
<l gn="56" n="56" rhyme="c" form="verse">Big discontent so breaking their contents.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="9">
<l gn="57" n="57" rhyme="a" form="verse">A reverend man that graz&#8217;d his cattle nigh,</l>
<l gn="58" n="58" rhyme="b" form="verse">Sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew</l>
<l gn="59" n="59" rhyme="a" form="verse">Of court, of city, and had let go by</l>
<l gn="60" n="60" rhyme="b" form="verse">The swiftest hours, observed as they flew,</l>
<l gn="61" n="61" rhyme="b" form="verse">Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,</l>
<l gn="62" n="62" rhyme="c" form="verse">And privileg&#8217;d by age desires to know</l>
<l gn="63" n="63" rhyme="c" form="verse">In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="10">
<l gn="64" n="64" rhyme="a" form="verse">So slides he down upon his grained bat,</l>
<l gn="65" n="65" rhyme="b" form="verse">And comely distant sits he by her side,</l>
<l gn="66" n="66" rhyme="a" form="verse">When he again desires her, being sat,</l>
<l gn="67" n="67" rhyme="b" form="verse">Her grievance with his hearing to divide:</l>
<l gn="68" n="68" rhyme="b" form="verse">If that from him there may be aught applied</l>
<l gn="69" n="69" rhyme="c" form="verse">Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,</l>
<l gn="70" n="70" rhyme="c" form="verse">&#8217;Tis promis&#8217;d in the charity of age.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="11">
<l gn="71" n="71" rhyme="a" form="verse">&#8220;Father,&#8221; she says, &#8220;though in me you behold</l>
<l gn="72" n="72" rhyme="b" form="verse">The injury of many a blasting hour,</l>
<l gn="73" n="73" rhyme="a" form="verse">Let it not tell your judgment I am old,</l>
<l gn="74" n="74" rhyme="b" form="verse">Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power;</l>
<l gn="75" n="75" rhyme="b" form="verse">I might as yet have been a spreading flower,</l>
<l gn="76" n="76" rhyme="c" form="verse">Fresh to myself, if I had self-applied</l>
<l gn="77" n="77" rhyme="c" form="verse">Love to myself, and to no love beside.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="12">
<l gn="78" n="78" rhyme="a" form="verse">&#8220;But woe is me, too early I attended</l>
<l gn="79" n="79" rhyme="b" form="verse">A youthful suit&#8212;it was to gain my grace;</l>
<l gn="80" n="80" rhyme="a" form="verse">O, one by nature&#8217;s outwards so commended</l>
<l gn="81" n="81" rhyme="b" form="verse">That maidens&#8217; eyes stuck over all his face.</l>
<l gn="82" n="82" rhyme="b" form="verse">Love lack&#8217;d a dwelling and made him her place;</l>
<l gn="83" n="83" rhyme="c" form="verse">And when in his fair parts she did abide,</l>
<l gn="84" n="84" rhyme="c" form="verse">She was new lodg&#8217;d and newly deified.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="13">
<l gn="85" n="85" rhyme="a" form="verse">&#8220;His browny locks did hang in crooked curls,</l>
<l gn="86" n="86" rhyme="b" form="verse">And every light occasion of the wind</l>
<l gn="87" n="87" rhyme="a" form="verse">Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.</l>
<l gn="88" n="88" rhyme="b" form="verse">What&#8217;s sweet to do, to do will aptly find:</l>
<l gn="89" n="89" rhyme="b" form="verse">Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,</l>
<l gn="90" n="90" rhyme="c" form="verse">For on his visage was in little drawn</l>
<l gn="91" n="91" rhyme="c" form="verse">What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="14">
<l gn="92" n="92" rhyme="a" form="verse">&#8220;Small show of man was yet upon his chin,</l>
<l gn="93" n="93" rhyme="b" form="verse">His phoenix down began but to appear</l>
<l gn="94" n="94" rhyme="a" form="verse">Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin,</l>
<l gn="95" n="95" rhyme="b" form="verse">Whose bare outbragg&#8217;d the web it seem&#8217;d to wear;</l>
<l gn="96" n="96" rhyme="b" form="verse">Yet showed his visage by that cost more dear,</l>
<l gn="97" n="97" rhyme="c" form="verse">And nice affections wavering stood in doubt</l>
<l gn="98" n="98" rhyme="c" form="verse">If best were as it was, or best without.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="15">
<l gn="99" n="99" rhyme="a" form="verse">&#8220;His qualities were beauteous as his form,</l>
<l gn="100" n="100" rhyme="b" form="verse">For maiden-tongu&#8217;d he was, and thereof free;</l>
<l gn="101" n="101" rhyme="a" form="verse">Yet if men mov&#8217;d him, was he such a storm</l>
<l gn="102" n="102" rhyme="b" form="verse">As oft &#8217;twixt May and April is to see,</l>
<l gn="103" n="103" rhyme="b" form="verse">When winds breathe sweet, unruly though they be.</l>
<l gn="104" n="104" rhyme="c" form="verse">His rudeness so with his authoriz&#8217;d youth</l>
<l gn="105" n="105" rhyme="c" form="verse">Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="16">
<l gn="106" n="106" rhyme="a" form="verse">&#8220;Well could he ride, and often men would say,</l>
<l gn="107" n="107" rhyme="b" form="verse">&#8216;That horse his mettle from his rider takes;</l>
<l gn="108" n="108" rhyme="a" form="verse">Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,</l>
<l gn="109" n="109" rhyme="b" form="verse">What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!&#8217;</l>
<l gn="110" n="110" rhyme="b" form="verse">And controversy hence a question takes,</l>
<l gn="111" n="111" rhyme="c" form="verse">Whether the horse by him became his deed,</l>
<l gn="112" n="112" rhyme="c" form="verse">Or he his manage by th&#8217; well-doing steed.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="17">
<l gn="113" n="113" rhyme="a" form="verse">&#8220;But quickly on this side the verdict went:</l>
<l gn="114" n="114" rhyme="b" form="verse">His real habitude gave life and grace</l>
<l gn="115" n="115" rhyme="a" form="verse">To appertainings and to ornament,</l>
<l gn="116" n="116" rhyme="b" form="verse">Accomplish&#8217;d in himself, not in his case;</l>
<l gn="117" n="117" rhyme="b" form="verse">All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,</l>
<l gn="118" n="118" rhyme="c" form="verse">Came for additions, yet their purpos&#8217;d trim</l>
<l gn="119" n="119" rhyme="c" form="verse">Piec&#8217;d not his grace but were all grac&#8217;d by him.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="18">
<l gn="120" n="120" rhyme="a" form="verse">&#8220;So on the tip of his subduing tongue</l>
<l gn="121" n="121" rhyme="b" form="verse">All kind of arguments and question deep,</l>
<l gn="122" n="122" rhyme="a" form="verse">All replication prompt and reason strong,</l>
<l gn="123" n="123" rhyme="b" form="verse">For his advantage still did wake and sleep.</l>
<l gn="124" n="124" rhyme="b" form="verse">To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,</l>
<l gn="125" n="125" rhyme="c" form="verse">He had the dialect and different skill,</l>
<l gn="126" n="126" rhyme="c" form="verse">Catching all passions in his craft of will,</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="19">
<l gn="127" n="127" rhyme="a" form="verse">&#8220;That he did in the general bosom reign</l>
<l gn="128" n="128" rhyme="b" form="verse">Of young, of old, and sexes both enchanted,</l>
<l gn="129" n="129" rhyme="a" form="verse">To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain</l>
<l gn="130" n="130" rhyme="b" form="verse">In personal duty, following where he haunted.</l>
<l gn="131" n="131" rhyme="b" form="verse">Consents bewitch&#8217;d, ere he desire, have granted,</l>
<l gn="132" n="132" rhyme="c" form="verse">And dialogu&#8217;d for him what he would say,</l>
<l gn="133" n="133" rhyme="c" form="verse">Ask&#8217;d their own wills and made their wills obey.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza num="20">
<l gn="134" n="134" rhyme="a" form="verse">&#8220;Many there were that did his picture get</l>
<l gn="135" n="135" rhyme="b" form="verse">To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind,</l>
<l gn="136" n="136" rhyme="a" form="verse">Like fools that in th&#8217; imagination set</l>
<l gn="137" n="137" rhyme="b" form="verse">The goodly objects which abroad they find</l>
<l gn="138" n="138" rhyme="b" form="verse">Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign&#8217;d,</l>
<l gn="139" n="139" rhyme="c" form="verse">And laboring in more pleasures to bestow them</l>

<l gn="143" n="143" rhyme="a" form="verse">My woeful self that did in freedom stand,</l>
<l gn="144" n="144" rhyme="b" form="verse">And was my own fee-simple (not in part),</l>
<l gn="145" n="145" rhyme="b" form="verse">What with his art in youth and youth in art,</l>
<l gn="146" n="146" rhyme="c" form="verse">Threw my affections in his charmed power,</l>

<l gn="151" n="151" rhyme="b" form="verse">With safest distance I mine honor shielded.</l>
<l gn="152" n="152" rhyme="b" form="verse">Experience for me many bulwarks builded</l>
<l gn="153" n="153" rhyme="c" form="verse">Of proofs new-bleeding which remain&#8217;d the foil</l>
