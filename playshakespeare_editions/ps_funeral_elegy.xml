<subtitle>TO MASTER JOHN PETER</subtitle>
<subtitle>of Bowhay in Devon, Esq.</subtitle>
<line globalnumber="1">The love I bore to your brother, and will do to his memory, hath crav'd from me this last duty of a friend; I am herein but a second to the privilege of Truth, who can warrant more in his behalf than I undertook to deliver. Exercise in this kind I will little affect, and am less addicted to, but there must be miracle in that labor which, to witness my remembrance to this departed gentleman, I would not willingly undergo. Yet whatsoever is here done, is done to him, and to him only. For whom and whose sake I will not forget to remember any friendly respects to you, or to any of those that have lov'd him for himself, and himself for his deserts.</line>

<stanza num="1">
<line globalnumber="2" number="1">Since Time, and his predestinated end,</line>
<line globalnumber="3" number="2">Abridg&#8217;d the circuit of his hopeful days,</line>
<line globalnumber="4" number="3">Whiles both his Youth and Virtue did intend</line>
<line globalnumber="5" number="4">The good endeavors of deserving praise,</line>
<line globalnumber="6" number="5">What memorable monument can last</line>
<line globalnumber="7" number="6">Whereon to build his never-blemish&#8217;d name</line>
<line globalnumber="8" number="7">But his own worth, wherein his life was grac&#8217;d&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="9" number="8">Sith as [that] ever he maintain&#8217;d the same?</line>
<line globalnumber="10" number="9">Oblivion in the darkest day to come,</line>
<line globalnumber="11" number="10">When sin shall tread on merit in the dust,</line>
<line globalnumber="12" number="11">Cannot rase out the lamentable tomb</line>
<line globalnumber="13" number="12">Of his short-liv&#8217;d deserts; but still they must,</line>
<line globalnumber="14" number="13">Even in the hearts and memories of men,</line>
<line globalnumber="15" number="14">Claim fit Respect, that they, in every limb</line>
<line globalnumber="16" number="15">Rememb&#8217;ring what he was, with comfort then</line>
<line globalnumber="17" number="16">May pattern out one truly good, by him.</line>
<line globalnumber="18" number="17">For he was truly good, if honest care</line>
<line globalnumber="19" number="18">Of harmless conversation may commend</line>
<line globalnumber="20" number="19">A life free from such stains as follies are,</line>
<line globalnumber="21" number="20">Ill recompensed only in his end.</line>
<line globalnumber="22" number="21">Nor can the tongue of him who lov&#8217;d him least</line>
<line globalnumber="23" number="22">(If there can be minority of love</line>
<line globalnumber="24" number="23">To one superlative above the rest</line>
<line globalnumber="25" number="24">Of many men in steady faith) reprove</line>
<line globalnumber="26" number="25">His constant temper, in the equal weight</line>
<line globalnumber="27" number="26">Of thankfulness and kindness: Truth doth leave</line>
<line globalnumber="28" number="27">Sufficient proof, he was in every right</line>
<line globalnumber="29" number="28">As kind to give, as thankful to receive.</line>
<line globalnumber="30" number="29">The curious eye of a quick-brain&#8217;d survey</line>
<line globalnumber="31" number="30">Could scantly find a mote amidst the sun</line>
<line globalnumber="32" number="31">Of his too-short&#8217;ned days, or make a prey</line>
<line globalnumber="33" number="32">Of any faulty errors he had done&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="34" number="33">Not that he was above the spleenful sense</line>
<line globalnumber="35" number="34">And spite of malice, but for that he had</line>
<line globalnumber="36" number="35">Warrant enough in his own innocence</line>
<line globalnumber="37" number="36">Against the sting of some in nature bad.</line>
<line globalnumber="38" number="37">Yet who is he so absolutely blest</line>
<line globalnumber="39" number="38">That lives encompass&#8217;d in a mortal frame,</line>
<line globalnumber="40" number="39">Sometime in reputation not oppress&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="41" number="40">By some in nothing famous but defame?</line>
<line globalnumber="42" number="41">Such in the By-path and the Ridgeway lurk</line>
<line globalnumber="43" number="42">That leads to ruin, in a smooth pretense</line>
<line globalnumber="44" number="43">Of what they do to be a special work</line>
<line globalnumber="45" number="44">Of singleness, not tending to offense;</line>
<line globalnumber="46" number="45">Whose very virtues are, not to detract</line>
<line globalnumber="47" number="46">Whiles hope remains of gain (base fee of slaves),</line>
<line globalnumber="48" number="47">Despising chiefly men in fortunes wrack&#8217;d&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="49" number="48">But death to such gives unrememb&#8217;red graves.</line>
<line globalnumber="50" number="49">Now therein liv&#8217;d he happy, if to be</line>
<line globalnumber="51" number="50">Free from detraction happiness it be.</line>
<line globalnumber="52" number="51">His younger years gave comfortable hope</line>
<line globalnumber="53" number="52">To hope for comfort in his riper youth,</line>
<line globalnumber="54" number="53">Which, harvest-like, did yield again the crop</line>
<line globalnumber="55" number="54">Of Education, better&#8217;d in his truth.</line>
<line globalnumber="56" number="55">Those noble twins of heaven-infused races,</line>
<line globalnumber="57" number="56">Learning and Wit, refined in their kind</line>
<line globalnumber="58" number="57">Did jointly both, in their peculiar graces,</line>
<line globalnumber="59" number="58">Enrich the curious temple of his mind;</line>
<line globalnumber="60" number="59">Indeed a temple, in whose precious white</line>
<line globalnumber="61" number="60">Sat Reason by Religion oversway&#8217;d,</line>
<line globalnumber="62" number="61">Teaching his other senses, with delight,</line>
<line globalnumber="63" number="62">How Piety and Zeal should be obey&#8217;d&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="64" number="63">Not fruitlessly in prodigal expense</line>
<line globalnumber="65" number="64">Wasting his best of time, but so content</line>
<line globalnumber="66" number="65">With Reason&#8217;s golden Mean to make defense</line>
<line globalnumber="67" number="66">Against the assault of youth&#8217;s encouragement;</line>
<line globalnumber="68" number="67">As not the tide of this surrounding age</line>
<line globalnumber="69" number="68">(When now his father&#8217;s death had freed his will)</line>
<line globalnumber="70" number="69">Could make him subject to the drunken rage</line>
<line globalnumber="71" number="70">Of such whose only glory is their ill.</line>
<line globalnumber="72" number="71">He from the happy knowledge of the wise</line>
<line globalnumber="73" number="72">Draws virtue to reprove secured fools</line>
<line globalnumber="74" number="73">And shuns the glad sleights of ensnaring vice</line>
<line globalnumber="75" number="74">To spend his spring of days in sacred schools.</line>
<line globalnumber="76" number="75">Here gave he diet to the sick desires</line>
<line globalnumber="77" number="76">That day by day assault the weaker man,</line>
<line globalnumber="78" number="77">And with fit moderation still retires</line>
<line globalnumber="79" number="78">From what doth batter virtue now and then.</line>
<line globalnumber="80" number="79">But that I not intend in full discourse</line>
<line globalnumber="81" number="80">To progress out his life, I could display</line>
<line globalnumber="82" number="81">A good man in each part exact and force</line>
<line globalnumber="83" number="82">The common voice to warrant what I say.</line>
<line globalnumber="84" number="83">For if his fate and heaven had decreed</line>
<line globalnumber="85" number="84">That full of days he might have liv&#8217;d to see</line>
<line globalnumber="86" number="85">The grave in peace, the times that should succeed</line>
<line globalnumber="87" number="86">Had been best-speaking witnesses with me;</line>
<line globalnumber="88" number="87">Whose conversation so untouch&#8217;d did move</line>
<line globalnumber="89" number="88">Respect most in itself, as who would scan</line>
<line globalnumber="90" number="89">His honesty and worth, by them might prove</line>
<line globalnumber="91" number="90">He was a kind, true, perfect gentleman&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="92" number="91">Not in the outside of disgraceful folly,</line>
<line globalnumber="93" number="92">Courting opinion with unfit disguise,</line>
<line globalnumber="94" number="93">Affecting fashions, nor addicted wholly</line>
<line globalnumber="95" number="94">To unbeseeming blushless vanities,</line>
<line globalnumber="96" number="95">But suiting so his habit and desire</line>
<line globalnumber="97" number="96">As that his Virtue was his best Attire.</line>
<line globalnumber="98" number="97">Not in the waste of many idle words</line>
<line globalnumber="99" number="98">Car&#8217;d he to be heard talk, nor in the float</line>
<line globalnumber="100" number="99">Of fond conceit, such as this age affords,</line>
<line globalnumber="101" number="100">By vain discourse upon himself to dote;</line>
<line globalnumber="102" number="101">For his becoming silence gave such grace</line>
<line globalnumber="103" number="102">To his judicious parts, as what he spake</line>
<line globalnumber="104" number="103">Seem&#8217;d rather answers which the wise embrace</line>
<line globalnumber="105" number="104">Than busy questions such as talkers make.</line>
<line globalnumber="106" number="105">And though his qualities might well deserve</line>
<line globalnumber="107" number="106">Just commendation, yet his furnish&#8217;d mind</line>
<line globalnumber="108" number="107">Such harmony of goodness did preserve</line>
<line globalnumber="109" number="108">As nature never built in better kind;</line>
<line globalnumber="110" number="109">Knowing the best, and therefore not presuming</line>
<line globalnumber="111" number="110">In knowing, but for that it was the best,</line>
<line globalnumber="112" number="111">Ever within himself free choice resuming</line>
<line globalnumber="113" number="112">Of true perfection, in a perfect breast;</line>
<line globalnumber="114" number="113">So that his mind and body made an inn,</line>
<line globalnumber="115" number="114">The one to lodge the other, both like fram&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="116" number="115">For fair conditions, guests that soonest win</line>
<line globalnumber="117" number="116">Applause; in generality, well fam&#8217;d,</line>
<line globalnumber="118" number="117">If trim behavior, gestures mild, discreet</line>
<line globalnumber="119" number="118">Endeavors, modest speech, beseeming mirth,</line>
<line globalnumber="120" number="119">True friendship, active grace, persuasion sweet,</line>
<line globalnumber="121" number="120">Delightful love innated from his birth,</line>
<line globalnumber="122" number="121">Acquaintance unfamiliar, carriage just,</line>
<line globalnumber="123" number="122">Offenseless resolution, wish&#8217;d sobriety,</line>
<line globalnumber="124" number="123">Clean-temper&#8217;d moderation, steady trust,</line>
<line globalnumber="125" number="124">Unburthen&#8217;d conscience, unfeign&#8217;d piety;</line>
<line globalnumber="126" number="125">If these, or all of these, knit fast in one</line>
<line globalnumber="127" number="126">Can merit praise, then justly may we say,</line>
<line globalnumber="128" number="127">Not any from this frailer stage is gone</line>
<line globalnumber="129" number="128">Whose name is like to live a longer day&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="130" number="129">Though not in eminent courts or places great</line>
<line globalnumber="131" number="130">For popular concourse, yet in that soil</line>
<line globalnumber="132" number="131">Where he enjoy&#8217;d his birth, life, death, and seat</line>
<line globalnumber="133" number="132">Which now sits mourning his untimely spoil. A</line>
<line globalnumber="134" number="133">nd as much glory is it to be good</line>
<line globalnumber="135" number="134">For private persons, in their private home,</line>
<line globalnumber="136" number="135">As those descended from illustrious blood</line>
<line globalnumber="137" number="136">In public view of greatness, whence they come.</line>
<line globalnumber="138" number="137">Though I, rewarded with some sadder taste</line>
<line globalnumber="139" number="138">Of knowing shame, by feeling it have prov&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="140" number="139">My country&#8217;s thankless misconstruction cast</line>
<line globalnumber="141" number="140">Upon my name and credit, both unlov&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="142" number="141">By some whose fortunes, sunk into the wane</line>
<line globalnumber="143" number="142">Of plenty and desert, have strove to win</line>
<line globalnumber="144" number="143">Justice by wrong, and sifted to embane</line>
<line globalnumber="145" number="144">My reputation with a witless sin;</line>
<line globalnumber="146" number="145">Yet time, the father of unblushing truth,</line>
<line globalnumber="147" number="146">May one day lay ope malice which hath cross&#8217;d it,</line>
<line globalnumber="148" number="147">And right the hopes of my endangered youth,</line>
<line globalnumber="149" number="148">Purchasing credit in the place I lost it.</line>
<line globalnumber="150" number="149">Even in which place the subject of the verse</line>
<line globalnumber="151" number="150">(Unhappy matter of a mourning style</line>
<line globalnumber="152" number="151">Which now that subject&#8217;s merits doth rehearse)</line>
<line globalnumber="153" number="152">Had education and new being; while</line>
<line globalnumber="154" number="153">By fair demeanor he had won repute</line>
<line globalnumber="155" number="154">Amongst the all of all that lived there,</line>
<line globalnumber="156" number="155">For that his actions did so wholly suit</line>
<line globalnumber="157" number="156">With worthiness, still memorable here.</line>
<line globalnumber="158" number="157">The many hours till the day of doom</line>
<line globalnumber="159" number="158">Will not consume his life and hapless end,</line>
<line globalnumber="160" number="159">For should he lie obscur&#8217;d without a tomb,</line>
<line globalnumber="161" number="160">Time would to time his honesty commend;</line>
<line globalnumber="162" number="161">Whiles parents to their children will make known,</line>
<line globalnumber="163" number="162">And they to their posterity impart,</line>
<line globalnumber="164" number="163">How such a man was sadly overthrown</line>
<line globalnumber="165" number="164">By a hand guided by a cruel heart,</line>
<line globalnumber="166" number="165">Whereof as many as shall hear that sadness</line>
<line globalnumber="167" number="166">Will blame the one&#8217;s hard fate, the other&#8217;s madness;</line>
<line globalnumber="168" number="167">Whiles such as do recount that tale of woe,</line>
<line globalnumber="169" number="168">Told by remembrance of the wisest heads,</line>
<line globalnumber="170" number="169">Will in the end conclude the matter so,</line>
<line globalnumber="171" number="170">As they will all go weeping to their beds.</line>
<line globalnumber="172" number="171">For when the world lies winter&#8217;d in the storms</line>
<line globalnumber="173" number="172">Of fearful consummation, and lays down</line>
<line globalnumber="174" number="173">Th&#8217; unsteady change of his fantastic forms,</line>
<line globalnumber="175" number="174">Expecting ever to be overthrown;</line>
<line globalnumber="176" number="175">When the proud height of much affected sin</line>
<line globalnumber="177" number="176">Shall ripen to a head, and in that pride</line>
<line globalnumber="178" number="177">End in the miseries it did begin</line>
<line globalnumber="179" number="178">And fall amidst the glory of his tide;</line>
<line globalnumber="180" number="179">Then in a book where every work is writ</line>
<line globalnumber="181" number="180">Shall this man&#8217;s actions be reveal&#8217;d, to show</line>
<line globalnumber="182" number="181">The gainful fruit of well-employed wit,</line>
<line globalnumber="183" number="182">Which paid to heaven the debt that it did owe.</line>
<line globalnumber="184" number="183">Here shall be reckon&#8217;d up the constant faith,</line>
<line globalnumber="185" number="184">Never untrue, where once he love profess&#8217;d;</line>
<line globalnumber="186" number="185">Which is a miracle in men, one saith,</line>
<line globalnumber="187" number="186">Long sought though rarely found, and he is best</line>
<line globalnumber="188" number="187">Who can make friendship, in those times of change,</line>
<line globalnumber="189" number="188">Admired more for being firm than strange.</line>
<line globalnumber="190" number="189">When those weak houses of our brittle flesh</line>
<line globalnumber="191" number="190">Shall ruin&#8217;d be by death, our grace and strength,</line>
<line globalnumber="192" number="191">Youth, memory and shape that made us fresh</line>
<line globalnumber="193" number="192">Cast down, and utterly decay&#8217;d at length;</line>
<line globalnumber="194" number="193">When all shall turn to dust from whence we came</line>
<line globalnumber="195" number="194">And we low-level&#8217;d in a narrow grave,</line>
<line globalnumber="196" number="195">What can we leave behind us but a name,</line>
<line globalnumber="197" number="196">Which, by a life well led, may honor have?</line>
<line globalnumber="198" number="197">Such honor, O thou youth untimely lost,</line>
<line globalnumber="199" number="198">Thou didst deserve and hast; for though thy soul</line>
<line globalnumber="200" number="199">Hath took her flight to a diviner coast,</line>
<line globalnumber="201" number="200">Yet here on earth thy fame lives ever whole,</line>
<line globalnumber="202" number="201">In every heart seal&#8217;d up, in every tongue</line>
<line globalnumber="203" number="202">Fit matter to discourse, no day prevented</line>
<line globalnumber="204" number="203">That pities not thy sad and sudden wrong,</line>
<line globalnumber="205" number="204">Of all alike beloved and lamented.</line>
<line globalnumber="206" number="205">And I here to thy memorable worth,</line>
<line globalnumber="207" number="206">In this last act of friendship, sacrifice</line>
<line globalnumber="208" number="207">My love to thee, which I could not set forth</line>
<line globalnumber="209" number="208">In any other habit of disguise.</line>
<line globalnumber="210" number="209">Although I could not learn, whiles yet thou wert,</line>
<line globalnumber="211" number="210">To speak the language of a servile breath,</line>
<line globalnumber="212" number="211">My truth stole from my tongue into my heart,</line>
<line globalnumber="213" number="212">Which shall not thence be sund&#8217;red, but in death.</line>
<line globalnumber="214" number="213">And I confess my love was too remiss</line>
<line globalnumber="215" number="214">That had not made thee know how much I priz&#8217;d thee,</line>
<line globalnumber="216" number="215">But that mine error was, as yet it is,</line>
<line globalnumber="217" number="216">To think love best in silence: for I siz&#8217;d thee</line>
<line globalnumber="218" number="217">By what I would have been, not only ready</line>
<line globalnumber="219" number="218">In telling I was thine, but being so,</line>
<line globalnumber="220" number="219">By some effect to show it. He is steady</line>
<line globalnumber="221" number="220">Who seems less than he is in open show.</line>
<line globalnumber="222" number="221">Since then I still reserv&#8217;d to try the worst</line>
<line globalnumber="223" number="222">Which hardest fate and time thus can lay on me.</line>
<line globalnumber="224" number="223">T&#8217; enlarge my thoughts was hindered at first,</line>
<line globalnumber="225" number="224">While thou hadst life; I took this task upon me,</line>
<line globalnumber="226" number="225">To register with mine unhappy pen</line>
<line globalnumber="227" number="226">Such duties as it owes to thy desert,</line>
<line globalnumber="228" number="227">And set thee as a president to men,</line>
<line globalnumber="229" number="228">And limn thee to the world but as thou wert&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="230" number="229">Not hir&#8217;d, as heaven can witness in my soul,</line>
<line globalnumber="231" number="230">By vain conceit, to please such ones as know it,</line>
<line globalnumber="232" number="231">Nor servile to be lik&#8217;d, free from control,</line>
<line globalnumber="233" number="232">Which, pain to many men, I do not owe it.</line>
<line globalnumber="234" number="233">But here I trust I have discharged now</line>
<line globalnumber="235" number="234">(Fair lovely branch too soon cut off) to thee,</line>
<line globalnumber="236" number="235">My constant and irrefragable vow,</line>
<line globalnumber="237" number="236">As, had it chanc&#8217;d, thou mightst have done to me&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="238" number="237">But that no merit strong enough of mine</line>
<line globalnumber="239" number="238">Had yielded store to thy well-abled quill</line>
<line globalnumber="240" number="239">Whereby t&#8217;enroll my name, as this of thine,</line>
<line globalnumber="241" number="240">How s&#8217;ere enriched by thy plenteous skill.</line>
<line globalnumber="242" number="241">Here, then, I offer up to memory</line>
<line globalnumber="243" number="242">The value of my talent, precious man,</line>
<line globalnumber="244" number="243">Whereby if thou live to posterity,</line>
<line globalnumber="245" number="244">Though&#8217;t be not as I would, &#8217;tis as I can:</line>
<line globalnumber="246" number="245">In minds from whence endeavor doth proceed,</line>
<line globalnumber="247" number="246">A ready will is taken for the deed.</line>
<line globalnumber="248" number="247">Yet ere I take my longest last farewell</line>
<line globalnumber="249" number="248">From thee, fair mark of sorrow, let me frame</line>
<line globalnumber="250" number="249">Some ampler work of thank, wherein to tell</line>
<line globalnumber="251" number="250">What more thou didst deserve than in thy name,</line>
<line globalnumber="252" number="251">And free thee from the scandal of such senses</line>
<line globalnumber="253" number="252">As in the rancor of unhappy spleen</line>
<line globalnumber="254" number="253">Measure thy course of life, with false pretenses</line>
<line globalnumber="255" number="254">Comparing by thy death what thou hast been.</line>
<line globalnumber="256" number="255">So in his mischiefs is the world accurs&#8217;d:</line>
<line globalnumber="257" number="256">It picks out matter to inform the worst.</line>
<line globalnumber="258" number="257">The willful blindness that hoodwinks the eyes</line>
<line globalnumber="259" number="258">Of men enwrapped in an earthy veil</line>
<line globalnumber="260" number="259">Makes them most ignorantly exercise</line>
<line globalnumber="261" number="260">And yield to humor when it doth assail,</line>
<line globalnumber="262" number="261">Whereby the candle and the body&#8217;s light</line>
<line globalnumber="263" number="262">Darkens the inward eyesight of the mind,</line>
<line globalnumber="264" number="263">Presuming still it sees, even in the night</line>
<line globalnumber="265" number="264">Of that same ignorance which makes them blind.</line>
<line globalnumber="266" number="265">Hence conster they with corrupt commentaries,</line>
<line globalnumber="267" number="266">Proceeding from a nature as corrupt,</line>
<line globalnumber="268" number="267">The text of malice, which so often varies</line>
<line globalnumber="269" number="268">As &#8217;tis by seeming reason underpropp&#8217;d.</line>
<line globalnumber="270" number="269">O, whither tends the lamentable spite</line>
<line globalnumber="271" number="270">Of this world&#8217;s teenful apprehension,</line>
<line globalnumber="272" number="271">Which understands all things amiss, whose light</line>
<line globalnumber="273" number="272">Shines not amidst the dark of their dissension?</line>
<line globalnumber="274" number="273">True &#8217;tis, this man, whiles yet he was a man,</line>
<line globalnumber="275" number="274">Sooth&#8217;d not the current of besotted fashion,</line>
<line globalnumber="276" number="275">Nor could digest, as some loose mimics can,</line>
<line globalnumber="277" number="276">An empty sound of overweening passion,</line>
<line globalnumber="278" number="277">So much to be made servant to the base</line>
<line globalnumber="279" number="278">And sensual aptness of disunion&#8217;d vices,</line>
<line globalnumber="280" number="279">To purchase commendation by disgrace,</line>
<line globalnumber="281" number="280">Whereto the world and heat of sin entices.</line>
<line globalnumber="282" number="281">But in a safer contemplation,</line>
<line globalnumber="283" number="282">Secure in what he knew, he ever chose</line>
<line globalnumber="284" number="283">The ready way to commendation,</line>
<line globalnumber="285" number="284">By shunning all invitements strange, of those</line>
<line globalnumber="286" number="285">Whose illness is, the necessary praise</line>
<line globalnumber="287" number="286">Must wait upon their actions; only rare</line>
<line globalnumber="288" number="287">In being rare in shame (which strives to raise</line>
<line globalnumber="289" number="288">Their name by doing what they do not care),</line>
<line globalnumber="290" number="289">As if the free commission of their ill</line>
<line globalnumber="291" number="290">Were even as boundless as their prompt desires;</line>
<line globalnumber="292" number="291">Only like lords, like subjects to their will,</line>
<line globalnumber="293" number="292">Which their fond dotage ever more admires.</line>
<line globalnumber="294" number="293">He was not so: but in a serious awe,</line>
<line globalnumber="295" number="294">Ruling the little ordered commonwealth</line>
<line globalnumber="296" number="295">Of his own self, with honor to the law</line>
<line globalnumber="297" number="296">That gave peace to his bread, bread to his health;</line>
<line globalnumber="298" number="297">Which ever he maintain&#8217;d in sweet content</line>
<line globalnumber="299" number="298">And pleasurable rest, wherein he joy&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="300" number="299">A monarchy of comfort&#8217;s government,</line>
<line globalnumber="301" number="300">Never until his last to be destroy&#8217;d.</line>
<line globalnumber="302" number="301">For in the Vineyard of heaven-favored learning</line>
<line globalnumber="303" number="302">Where he was double-honor&#8217;d in degree,</line>
<line globalnumber="304" number="303">His observation and discreet discerning</line>
<line globalnumber="305" number="304">Had taught him in both fortunes to be free;</line>
<line globalnumber="306" number="305">Whence now retir&#8217;d home, to a home indeed</line>
<line globalnumber="307" number="306">The home of his condition and estate,</line>
<line globalnumber="308" number="307">He well provided &#8217;gainst the hand of need,</line>
<line globalnumber="309" number="308">Whence young men sometime grow unfortunate;</line>
<line globalnumber="310" number="309">His disposition, by the bonds of unity,</line>
<line globalnumber="311" number="310">So fast&#8217;ned to his reason that it strove</line>
<line globalnumber="312" number="311">With understanding&#8217;s grave immunity</line>
<line globalnumber="313" number="312">To purchase from all hearts a steady love;</line>
<line globalnumber="314" number="313">Wherein not any one thing comprehends</line>
<line globalnumber="315" number="314">Proportionable note of what he was,</line>
<line globalnumber="316" number="315">Than that he was so constant to his friends</line>
<line globalnumber="317" number="316">As he would no occasion overpass</line>
<line globalnumber="318" number="317">Which might make known his unaffected care,</line>
<line globalnumber="319" number="318">In all respects of trial, to unlock</line>
<line globalnumber="320" number="319">His bosom and his store, which did declare</line>
<line globalnumber="321" number="320">That Christ was his, and he was Friendship&#8217;s Rock:</line>
<line globalnumber="322" number="321">A Rock of Friendship figured in his name,</line>
<line globalnumber="323" number="322">Fore-shewing what he was, and what should be,</line>
<line globalnumber="324" number="323">Most true presage; and he discharg&#8217;d the same</line>
<line globalnumber="325" number="324">In every act of perfect amity&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="326" number="325">Though in the complemental phrase of words</line>
<line globalnumber="327" number="326">He never was addicted to the vain</line>
<line globalnumber="328" number="327">Of boast, such as the common breath affords;</line>
<line globalnumber="329" number="328">He was in use most fast, in tongue most plain,</line>
<line globalnumber="330" number="329">Nor amongst all those virtues that forever</line>
<line globalnumber="331" number="330">Adorn&#8217;d his reputation will be found</line>
<line globalnumber="332" number="331">One greater than his Faith, which did persever,</line>
<line globalnumber="333" number="332">Where once it was protested, alway sound.</line>
<line globalnumber="334" number="333">Hence sprung the deadly fuel that reviv&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="335" number="334">The rage which wrought his end, for had he been</line>
<line globalnumber="336" number="335">Slacker in love, he had been longer liv&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="337" number="336">And not oppress&#8217;d by wrath&#8217;s unhappy sin&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="338" number="337">By wrath&#8217;s unhappy sin, which unadvis&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="339" number="338">Gave death for free good will, and wounds for love.</line>
<line globalnumber="340" number="339">Pity it was that blood had not been priz&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="341" number="340">At higher rate, and reason set above</line>
<line globalnumber="342" number="341">Most unjust choler, which untimely</line>
<line globalnumber="343" number="342">Drew Destruction on itself; and most unjust,</line>
<line globalnumber="344" number="343">Robb&#8217;d virtue of a follower so true</line>
<line globalnumber="345" number="344">As time can boast of, both for love and trust:</line>
<line globalnumber="346" number="345">So henceforth all (great glory to his blood)</line>
<line globalnumber="347" number="346">Shall be but seconds to him, being good.</line>
<line globalnumber="348" number="347">The wicked end their honor with their sin</line>
<line globalnumber="349" number="348">In death, which only then the good begin.</line>
<line globalnumber="350" number="349">Lo, here a lesson by experience taught</line>
<line globalnumber="351" number="350">For men whose pure simplicity hath drawn</line>
<line globalnumber="352" number="351">Their trust to be betray&#8217;d by being caught</line>
<line globalnumber="353" number="352">Within the snares of making truth a pawn;</line>
<line globalnumber="354" number="353">Whiles it, not doubting whereinto it enters,</line>
<line globalnumber="355" number="354">Without true proof and knowledge of a friend,</line>
<line globalnumber="356" number="355">Sincere in singleness of heart, adventers</line>
<line globalnumber="357" number="356">To give fit cause, ere love begin to end:</line>
<line globalnumber="358" number="357">His unfeign&#8217;d friendship where it least was sought,</line>
<line globalnumber="359" number="358">Him to a fatal timeless ruin brought;</line>
<line globalnumber="360" number="359">Whereby the life that purity adorn&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="361" number="360">With real merit, by this sudden end</line>
<line globalnumber="362" number="361">Is in the mouth of some in manner scorn&#8217;d,</line>
<line globalnumber="363" number="362">Made questionable, for they do intend,</line>
<line globalnumber="364" number="363">According to the tenor of the saw</line>
<line globalnumber="365" number="364">Mistook, if not observ&#8217;d (writ long ago</line>
<line globalnumber="366" number="365">When men were only led by Reason&#8217;s law),</line>
<line globalnumber="367" number="366">That "Such as is the end, the life proves so."</line>
<line globalnumber="368" number="367">Thus he, who to the universal lapse</line>
<line globalnumber="369" number="368">Gave sweet redemption, off&#8217;ring up his blood</line>
<line globalnumber="370" number="369">To conquer death by death, and loose the traps</line>
<line globalnumber="371" number="370">Of hell, even in the triumph that it stood:</line>
<line globalnumber="372" number="371">He thus, for that his guiltless life was spilt</line>
<line globalnumber="373" number="372">By death, which was made subject to the curse,</line>
<line globalnumber="374" number="373">Might in like manner be reprov&#8217;d of guilt</line>
<line globalnumber="375" number="374">In his pure life, for that his end was worse.</line>
<line globalnumber="376" number="375">But O far be it, our unholy lips</line>
<line globalnumber="377" number="376">Should so profane the deity above</line>
<line globalnumber="378" number="377">As thereby to ordain revenging whips</line>
<line globalnumber="379" number="378">Against the day of Judgment and of Love.</line>
<line globalnumber="380" number="379">The hand that lends us honor in our days</line>
<line globalnumber="381" number="380">May shorten when it please, and justly take</line>
<line globalnumber="382" number="381">Our honor from us many sundry ways,</line>
<line globalnumber="383" number="382">As best becomes that wisdom did us make.</line>
<line globalnumber="384" number="383">The second brother, who was next begot</line>
<line globalnumber="385" number="384">Of all that ever were begotten yet,</line>
<line globalnumber="386" number="385">Was by a hand in vengeance rude and hot</line>
<line globalnumber="387" number="386">Sent innocent to be in heaven set&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="388" number="387">Whose fame the angels in melodious choirs</line>
<line globalnumber="389" number="388">Still witness to the world. Then why should he,</line>
<line globalnumber="390" number="389">Well-profited in excellent desires,</line>
<line globalnumber="391" number="390">Be more rebuk&#8217;d, who had like destiny?</line>

<line globalnumber="396" number="395">But tasted of the sour-bitter scourge</line>
<line globalnumber="397" number="396">Of torture and affliction ere they gained</line>
<line globalnumber="398" number="397">Those blessings which their sufferance did urge,</line>
<line globalnumber="399" number="398">Whereby the grace fore-promis&#8217;d they attained.</line>
<line globalnumber="400" number="399">Let then the false suggestions of the froward,</line>

<line globalnumber="444" number="443">Which, underneath the roof of safe content,</line>
<line globalnumber="445" number="444">Feeds on the bread of rest, and takes delight</line>

<line globalnumber="469" number="468">With all what men in eminence possess,</line>
<line globalnumber="470" number="469">Are, without ornaments to praise them, vile:</line>
<line globalnumber="471" number="470">The beauty of the mind is nobleness.</line>

<line globalnumber="482" number="481">Depends upon the goodness of the man,</line>
<line globalnumber="483" number="482">Which afterwards his praises will express.</line>
<line globalnumber="484" number="483">Look hither then, you that enjoy the youth</line>
<line globalnumber="485" number="484">Of your best days, and see how unexpected</line>
<line globalnumber="486" number="485">Death can betray your jollity to ruth</line>
<line globalnumber="487" number="486">When death you think is least to be respected!</line>
<line globalnumber="488" number="487">The person of this model here set out</line>

<line globalnumber="494" number="493">His flourishing and fair long-liv&#8217;d deserts,</line>
<line globalnumber="495" number="494">Above fate&#8217;s reach, his singleness was such&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="496" number="495">So that he dies but once, but doubly lives,</line>
<line globalnumber="497" number="496">Once in his proper self, then in his name;</line>
<line globalnumber="498" number="497">Predestinated Time, who all deprives,</line>
<line globalnumber="499" number="498">Could never yet deprive him of the same.</line>
<line globalnumber="500" number="499">And had the Genius which attended on him</line>
<line globalnumber="501" number="500">Been possibilited to keep him safe</line>
<line globalnumber="502" number="501">Against the rigor that hath overgone him,</line>
<line globalnumber="503" number="502">He had been to the public use a staff,</line>
<line globalnumber="504" number="503">Leading by his example in the path</line>

<line globalnumber="507" number="506">Informed rightly in the courses true.</line>
<line globalnumber="508" number="507">As then the loss of one, whose inclination</line>
<line globalnumber="509" number="508">Strove to win love in general, is sad,</line>
<line globalnumber="510" number="509">So specially his friends, in soft compassion</line>

<line globalnumber="516" number="515">The chaste embracements of conjugal love,</line>
<line globalnumber="517" number="516">Who in a mutual harmony consent,</line>
<line globalnumber="518" number="517">Are so impatient of a strange remove</line>
<line globalnumber="519" number="518">As meager death itself seems to lament,</line>
<line globalnumber="520" number="519">And weep upon those cheeks which nature fram&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="521" number="520">To be delightful orbs in whom the force</line>
<line globalnumber="522" number="521">Of lively sweetness plays, so that asham&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="523" number="522">Death often pities his unkind divorce.</line>
<line globalnumber="524" number="523">Such was the separation here constrain&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="525" number="524">(Well-worthy to be termed a rudeness rather),</line>
<line globalnumber="526" number="525">For in his life his love was so unfeign&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="527" number="526">As he was both an husband and a father&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="528" number="527">The one in firm affection and the other</line>
<line globalnumber="529" number="528">In careful providence, which ever strove</line>

<line globalnumber="531" number="530">With every helpful furtherance of love.</line>
<line globalnumber="532" number="531">But since the sum of all that can be said</line>
<line globalnumber="533" number="532">Can be but said that "He was good"</line>
<line globalnumber="534" number="533">(which wholly Includes all excellence can be display&#8217;d</line>
<line globalnumber="535" number="534">In praise of virtue and reproach of folly).</line>
<line globalnumber="536" number="535">His due deserts, this sentence on him gives,</line>
<line globalnumber="537" number="536">"He died in life, yet in his death he lives."</line>
<line globalnumber="538" number="537">Now runs the method of this doleful song</line>
<line globalnumber="539" number="538">In accents brief to thee, O thou deceas&#8217;d!</line>
<line globalnumber="540" number="539">To whom those pains do only all belong</line>
<line globalnumber="541" number="540">As witnesses I did not love thee least.</line>
<line globalnumber="542" number="541">For could my worthless brain find out but how</line>
<line globalnumber="543" number="542">To raise thee from the sepulcher of dust,</line>
<line globalnumber="544" number="543">Undoubtedly thou shouldst have partage now</line>
<line globalnumber="545" number="544">Of life with me, and heaven be counted just</line>
<line globalnumber="546" number="545">If to a supplicating soul it would</line>
<line globalnumber="547" number="546">Give life anew, by giving life again</line>
<line globalnumber="548" number="547">Where life is miss&#8217;d; whereby discomfort should</line>
<line globalnumber="549" number="548">Right his old griefs, and former joys retain</line>
<line globalnumber="550" number="549">Which now with thee are leap&#8217;d into thy tomb</line>
<line globalnumber="551" number="550">And buried in that hollow vault of woe,</line>
<line globalnumber="552" number="551">Expecting yet a more severer doom</line>
<line globalnumber="553" number="552">Than time&#8217;s strict flinty hand will let &#8217;em know.</line>
<line globalnumber="554" number="553">And now if I have level&#8217;d mine account</line>
<line globalnumber="555" number="554">And reckon&#8217;d up in a true measured score</line>
<line globalnumber="556" number="555">Those perfect graces which were ever wont</line>
<line globalnumber="557" number="556">To wait on thee alive, I ask no more</line>
<line globalnumber="558" number="557">(But shall hereafter in a poor content</line>
<line globalnumber="559" number="558">Immure those imputations I sustain,</line>
<line globalnumber="560" number="559">Learning my days of youth so to prevent</line>
<line globalnumber="561" number="560">As not to be cast down by them again)&#8212;</line>
<line globalnumber="562" number="561">Only those hopes which fate denies to grant</line>
<line globalnumber="563" number="562">In full possession to a captive heart</line>
<line globalnumber="564" number="563">Who, if it were in plenty, still would want</line>
<line globalnumber="565" number="564">Before it may enjoy his better part;</line>
<line globalnumber="566" number="565">From which detain&#8217;d, and banish&#8217;d in th&#8217; exile</line>
<line globalnumber="567" number="566">Of dim misfortune, has none other prop</line>
<line globalnumber="568" number="567">Whereon to lean and rest itself the while</line>
<line globalnumber="569" number="568">But the weak comfort of the hapless, Hope.</line>
<line globalnumber="570" number="569">And Hope must in despite of fearful change</line>
<line globalnumber="571" number="570">Play in the strongest closet of my breast,</line>
<line globalnumber="572" number="571">Although perhaps I ignorantly range</line>
<line globalnumber="573" number="572">And court opinion in my deep&#8217;st unrest.</line>
<line globalnumber="574" number="573">But whether doth the stream of my mischance</line>
<line globalnumber="575" number="574">Drive me beyond myself, fast friend, soon lost,</line>
<line globalnumber="576" number="575">Long may thy worthiness thy name advance</line>
<line globalnumber="577" number="576">Amongst the virtuous and deserving most,</line>
<line globalnumber="578" number="577">Who herein hast forever happy prov&#8217;d:</line>
<line globalnumber="579" number="578">In life thou liv&#8217;dst, in death thou died&#8217;st belov&#8217;d.</line>
