<l gn="189" n="5" form="prose">If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men&#8217;s cottages princes&#8217; palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done, than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o&#8217;er a cold decree&#8212;such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o&#8217;er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word choose! I may neither choose who I would, nor refuse who I dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curb&#8217;d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?</l>

But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Portia">POR.</speaker>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Portia">POR.</speaker>
<l gn="193" n="9" form="prose">Ay, that&#8217;s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play&#8217;d false with a smith.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Portia">POR.</speaker>
<l gn="195" n="11" form="prose">He doth nothing but frown, as who should say, &#8220;And you will not have me, choose.&#8221; He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be married to a death&#8217;s-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Nerissa">NER.</speaker>
<l gn="196" n="12" form="prose">How say you by the French lord,  Le Bon?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Portia">POR.</speaker>
<l gn="197" n="13" form="prose">God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he! Why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan&#8217;s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palentine; he is every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap&#8217;ring. He will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I shall never requite him.</l>

<l gn="198" n="14" form="prose">What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Portia">POR.</speaker>
<l gn="199" n="15" form="prose">You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him. He hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man&#8217;s picture, but alas, who can converse with a dumb show? How oddly he is suited!

<l gn="201" n="17" form="prose">That he hath a neighborly charity in him, for he borrow&#8217;d a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able. I think the Frenchman became his surety and seal&#8217;d under for another.</l>

<l gn="205" n="21" form="prose">Therefore for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within, and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do any thing, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.</l>

But ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks.
