<subtitle>The Argument</subtitle>
<line globalnumber="4" type="argument">Lucius Tarquinius (for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus), after he had caused his own father-in-law Servius Tullius to be cruelly murd&#8217;red, and contrary to the Roman laws and customs, not requiring or staying for the people&#8217;s suffrages, had possessed himself of the kingdom, went, accompanied with his sons and other noblemen of Rome, to besiege Ardea; during which siege, the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of Sextus Tarquinius, the King&#8217;s son, in their discourses after supper every one commended the virtues of his own wife; among whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife Lucretia. In that pleasant humor they all posted to Rome, and intending by their secret and sudden arrival to make trial of that which every one had before avouched, only Collatinus finds his wife (though it were late in the night) spinning amongest her maids; the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling, or in several disports; whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus the victory, and his wife the fame. At that time Sextus Tarquinius being inflamed with Lucrece&#8217; beauty, yet smothering his passions for the present, departed with the rest back to the camp; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself, and was (according to his estate) royally entertained and lodged by Lucrece at Collatium. The same night he treacherously stealeth into her chamber, violently ravish&#8217;d her, and early in the morning speedeth away. Lucrece, in this lamentable plight, hastily dispatcheth messengers, one to Rome for her father, another to the camp for Collatine. They came, the one accompanied with Junius Brutus, the other with Publius Valerius; and finding Lucrece attired in mourning habit, demanded the cause of her sorrow. She, first taking an oath of them for her revenge, revealed the actor, and whole manner of his dealing, and withal suddenly stabbed herself. Which done, with one consent they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the Tarquins; and bearing the dead body to Rome, Brutus acquainted the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed; with a bitter invective against the tyranny of the King, wherewith the people were so moved, that with one consent and a general acclamation the Tarquins were all exiled, and the state government changed from kings to consuls.</line>

<line globalnumber="1842" number="1838" rhyme="b">By all our country rights in Rome maintained,</line>
<line globalnumber="1843" number="1839" rhyme="b">And by chaste Lucrece&#8217; soul that late complained</line>

<line globalnumber="1847" number="1843" rhyme="b">And kiss&#8217;d the fatal knife to end his vow;</line>
<line globalnumber="1848" number="1844" rhyme="a">And to his protestation urg&#8217;d the rest,</line>
<line globalnumber="1849" number="1845" rhyme="b">Who wond&#8217;ring at him, did his words allow.</line>
<line globalnumber="1850" number="1846" rhyme="b">Then jointly to the ground their knees they bow,</line>

<couplet>
<line globalnumber="1858" number="1854" rhyme="c">The Romans plausibly did give consent</line>
<line globalnumber="1859" number="1855" rhyme="c">To Tarquin&#8217;s everlasting banishment.</line>
