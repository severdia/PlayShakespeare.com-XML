<line globalnumber="3" number="3">How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line globalnumber="4" number="4">But few of any sort, and none of name.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="5" number="5">A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestow&#8217;d much honor on a young Florentine call&#8217;d Claudio.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="6" number="6">Much deserv&#8217;d on his part, and equally rememb&#8217;red by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed better bett&#8217;red expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="7" number="7">He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.</line>

<line globalnumber="8" number="8">I have already deliver&#8217;d him letters, and there appears much joy in him, even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="9" number="9">Did he break out into tears?</line>

<line globalnumber="10" number="10">In great measure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="11" number="11">A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those that are so wash&#8217;d. How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="17" number="17">He set up his bills here in Messina, and challeng&#8217;d Cupid at the flight, and my uncle&#8217;s fool, reading the challenge, subscrib&#8217;d for Cupid, and challeng&#8217;d him at the burbolt. I pray you, how many hath he kill&#8217;d and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he kill&#8217;d? For indeed I promis&#8217;d to eat all of his killing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="18" number="18">Faith, niece, you tax <italian xml:lang="it">Signior</italian> Benedick too much, but he&#8217;ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="19" number="19">He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="20" number="20">You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it. He is a very valiant trencherman, he hath an excellent stomach.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="21" number="21">And a good soldier too, lady.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="22" number="22">And a good soldier to a lady, but what is he to a lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="23" number="23">A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuff&#8217;d with all honorable virtues.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="24" number="24">It is so indeed, he is no less than a stuff&#8217;d man. But for the stuffing&#8212;well, we are all mortal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="25" number="25">You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war betwixt <italian xml:lang="it">Signior</italian> Benedick and her; they never meet but there&#8217;s a skirmish of wit between them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="26" number="26">Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man govern&#8217;d with one; so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse, for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="27" number="27">Is&#8217;t possible?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="28" number="28">Very easily possible. He wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat: it ever changes with the next block.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="29" number="29">I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="30" number="30">No, and he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="31" number="31">He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="32" number="32">O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease; he is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere &#8217;a be cur&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="33" number="33">I will hold friends with you, lady.</line>

I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe; I have known when he would have walk&#8217;d ten mile afoot to see a good armor, and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet; he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose (like an honest man and a soldier), and now is he turn&#8217;d orthography&#8212;his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not. I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster, but I&#8217;ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace.

<line globalnumber="449" number="97">This can be no trick: the conference was sadly borne; they have the truth of this from Hero; they seem to pity the lady. It seems her affections have their full bent. Love me? Why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censur&#8217;d; they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her; they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry. I must not seem proud; happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to mending. 
They say the lady is fair; &#8217;tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; &#8217;tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have rail&#8217;d so long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. 
Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humor? No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day, she&#8217;s a fair lady. I do spy some marks of love in her.</line>

Well, for your favor, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it, and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince&#8217;s name.</line>

<line globalnumber="655" number="21">Truly by your office you may, but I think they that touch pitch will be defil&#8217;d. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him show himself what he is, and steal out of your company.</line>

<line globalnumber="664" number="30">Five shillings to one on&#8217;t, with any man that knows the statutes, he may stay him; marry, not without the Prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offense to stay a man against his will.</line>
