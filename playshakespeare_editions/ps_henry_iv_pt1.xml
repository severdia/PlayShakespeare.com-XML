<l gn="109" n="1" form="prose">Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Henry, Prince of Wales">PRINCE.</speaker>
<l gn="110" n="2" form="prose">Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldest truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? Unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons, and clocks the tongues of bawds, and dials the signs of leaping-houses, and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame-color&#8217;d taffeta; I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Sir John Falstaff">FAL.</speaker>
<l gn="111" n="3" form="prose">Indeed you come near me now, Hal, for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not by Phoebus, he, &#8220;that wand&#8217;ring knight so fair.&#8221; And I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art a king, as, God save thy Grace&#8212;Majesty I should say, for grace thou wilt have none&#8288;&#8212;</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Sir John Falstaff">FAL.</speaker>
<l gn="115" n="7" form="prose">Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that are squires of the night&#8217;s body be call&#8217;d thieves of the day&#8217;s beauty. Let us be Diana&#8217;s foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the moon, and let men say we be men of good government, being govern&#8217;d, as the sea is, by our noble and chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Henry, Prince of Wales">PRINCE.</speaker>
<l gn="116" n="8" form="prose">Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the fortune of us that are the moon&#8217;s men doth ebb and flow like the sea, being govern&#8217;d, as the sea is, by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold most resolutely snatch&#8217;d on Monday night and most dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with swearing &#8220;Lay by,&#8221; and spent with crying &#8220;Bring in&#8221;; now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder, and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.</l>

<l gn="125" n="17" form="prose">Yea, and so us&#8217;d it that, were it not here apparent that thou art heir apparent&#8212;But I prithee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when thou art king? And resolution thus fubb&#8217;d as it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.</l>
</sp>

<l gn="135" n="27" form="prose">Thou hast the most unsavory similes and art indeed the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young prince. But, Hal, I prithee trouble me no more with vanity; I would to God thou and I knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought. An old lord of the Council rated me the other day in the street about you, sir, but I mark&#8217;d him not, and yet he talk&#8217;d very wisely, but I regarded him not, and yet he talk&#8217;d wisely, and in the street too.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Henry, Prince of Wales">PRINCE.</speaker>
<l gn="136" n="28" form="prose">Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the streets, and no man regards it.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Sir John Falstaff">FAL.</speaker>
<l gn="137" n="29" form="prose">O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeed able to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal, God forgive thee for it! Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give it over. By the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain, I&#8217;ll be damn&#8217;d for never a king&#8217;s son in Christendom.</l>

Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers, and can call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy, and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy (by the Lord, so they call me!), and when I am King of England I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing scarlet, and when you breathe in your watering, they cry &#8220;hem!&#8221; and bid you play it off. To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honor that thou wert not with me in this action. But, sweet Ned&#8212;to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapp&#8217;d even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that never spake other English in his life than &#8220;Eight shillings and sixpence,&#8221; and &#8220;You are welcome,&#8221; with this shrill addition, &#8220;Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon,&#8221; or so. But, Ned, to drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar, and do thou never leave calling &#8220;Francis,&#8221; that his tale to me may be nothing but &#8220;Anon.&#8221; Step aside, and I&#8217;ll show thee a president.</l>

That thou art my son I have partly thy mother&#8217;s word, partly my own opinion, but chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye, and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point: why being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries? A question not to be ask&#8217;d. Shall the son of England prove a thief and take purses? A question to be ask&#8217;d. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch. This pitch (as ancient writers do report) doth defile, so doth the company thou keepest; for, Harry, now I do not speak to thee in drink, but in tears; not in pleasure, but in passion; not in words only, but in woes also. And yet there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.</l>

If that man should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that Falstaff; him keep with, the rest banish.

<l gn="1197" n="31" form="verse">Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.</l>
<l gn="1198" n="32" form="verse">Thy place in Council thou hast rudely lost,</l>
<l gn="1199" n="33" form="verse">Which by thy younger brother is supplied,</l>
<l gn="1200" n="34" form="verse">And art almost an alien to the hearts</l>
<l gn="1201" n="35" form="verse">Of all the court and princes of my blood;</l>
<l gn="1202" n="36" form="verse">The hope and expectation of thy time</l>

<l gn="1204" n="38" form="verse">Prophetically do forethink thy fall.</l>
<l gn="1205" n="39" form="verse">Had I so lavish of my presence been,</l>
<l gn="1206" n="40" form="verse">So common-hackney&#8217;d in the eyes of men,</l>
<l gn="1207" n="41" form="verse">So stale and cheap to vulgar company,</l>
<l gn="1208" n="42" form="verse">Opinion, that did help me to the crown,</l>
<l gn="1209" n="43" form="verse">Had still kept loyal to possession,</l>
<l gn="1210" n="44" form="verse">And left me in reputeless banishment,</l>
<l gn="1211" n="45" form="verse">A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.</l>
<l gn="1212" n="46" form="verse">By being seldom seen, I could not stir</l>
<l gn="1213" n="47" form="verse">But like a comet I was wond&#8217;red at,</l>

<l gn="1215" n="49" form="verse">Others would say, &#8220;Where, which is Bullingbrook?&#8221;</l>
<l gn="1216" n="50" form="verse">And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,</l>
<l gn="1217" n="51" form="verse">And dress&#8217;d myself in such humility</l>
<l gn="1218" n="52" form="verse">That I did pluck allegiance from men&#8217;s hearts,</l>
<l gn="1219" n="53" form="verse">Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,</l>
<l gn="1220" n="54" form="verse">Even in the presence of the crowned King.</l>
<l gn="1221" n="55" form="verse">Thus did I keep my person fresh and new,</l>
<l gn="1222" n="56" form="verse">My presence, like a robe pontifical,</l>
<l gn="1223" n="57" form="verse">Ne&#8217;er seen but wond&#8217;red at, and so my state,</l>
<l gn="1224" n="58" form="verse">Seldom but sumptuous, show&#8217;d like a feast,</l>
<l gn="1225" n="59" form="verse">And wan by rareness such solemnity.</l>

<l gn="1227" n="61" form="verse">With shallow jesters, and rash bavin wits,</l>
<l gn="1228" n="62" form="verse">Soon kindled and soon burnt, carded his state,</l>
<l gn="1229" n="63" form="verse">Mingled his royalty with cap&#8217;ring fools,</l>
<l gn="1230" n="64" form="verse">Had his great name profaned with their scorns,</l>
<l gn="1231" n="65" form="verse">And gave his countenance, against his name,</l>
<l gn="1232" n="66" form="verse">To laugh at gibing boys, and stand the push</l>
<l gn="1233" n="67" form="verse">Of every beardless vain comparative,</l>
<l gn="1234" n="68" form="verse">Grew a companion to the common streets,</l>
<l gn="1235" n="69" form="verse">Enfeoff&#8217;d himself to popularity,</l>
<l gn="1236" n="70" form="verse">That, being daily swallowed by men&#8217;s eyes,</l>
<l gn="1237" n="71" form="verse">They surfeited with honey and began</l>

<l gn="1239" n="73" form="verse">More than a little is by much too much.</l>
<l gn="1240" n="74" form="verse">So when he had occasion to be seen,</l>
<l gn="1241" n="75" form="verse">He was but as the cuckoo is in June,</l>
<l gn="1242" n="76" form="verse">Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes</l>
<l gn="1243" n="77" form="verse">As, sick and blunted with community,</l>
<l gn="1244" n="78" form="verse">Afford no extraordinary gaze,</l>
<l gn="1245" n="79" form="verse">Such as is bent on sunlike majesty</l>
<l gn="1246" n="80" form="verse">When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;</l>
<l gn="1247" n="81" form="verse">But rather drows&#8217;d and hung their eyelids down,</l>

I press me none but good householders, yeomen&#8217;s sons, inquire me out contracted bachelors, such as had been ask&#8217;d twice on the banes, such a commodity of warm slaves, as had as lief hear the devil as a drum, such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck. I press&#8217;d me none but such toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins&#8217; heads, and they have bought out their services; and now my whole charge consists of ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of companies&#8212;slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth, where the glutton&#8217;s dogs lick&#8217;d his sores, and such as indeed were never soldiers, but discarded unjust servingmen, younger sons to younger brothers, revolted tapsters, and ostlers trade-fall&#8217;n, the cankers of a calm world and a long peace, ten times more dishonorable ragged than an old feaz&#8217;d ancient: and such have I, to fill up the rooms of them as have bought out their services, that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty totter&#8217;d prodigals lately come from swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and press&#8217;d the dead bodies. No eye hath seen such scarecrows. I&#8217;ll not march through Coventry with them, that&#8217;s flat. Nay, and the villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had gyves on, for indeed I had the most of them out of prison. There&#8217;s not a shirt and a half in all my company, and the half shirt is two napkins tack&#8217;d together and thrown over the shoulders like a herald&#8217;s coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say the truth, stol&#8217;n from my host at Saint Albans, or the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry.
