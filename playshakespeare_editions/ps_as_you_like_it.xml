My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or (to speak more properly) stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better, for besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly hir&#8217;d; but I (his brother) gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</l>

Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well. Your brother is but young and tender, and for your love I would be loath to foil him, as I must for my own honor if he come in; therefore out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search, and altogether against my will.</l>

I had myself notice of my brother&#8217;s purpose herein, and have by underhand means labor&#8217;d to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I&#8217;ll tell thee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man&#8217;s good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother; therefore use thy discretion&#8212; I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to&#8217;t; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practice against thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta&#8217;en thy life by some indirect means or other; for I assure thee (and almost with tears I speak it) there is not one so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.</l>

<l gn="777" n="151" form="verse">Jealous in honor, sudden, and quick in quarrel,</l>
<l gn="778" n="152" form="verse">Seeking the bubble reputation</l>

<l gn="858" n="12" form="prose">Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in respect that it is a shepherd&#8217;s life, it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vild life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life (look you) it fits my humor well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</l>

</sp>
<sp>

<l gn="866" n="20" form="prose">Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw&#8217;st good manners; if thou never saw&#8217;st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Corin">COR.</speaker>
<l gn="867" n="21" form="prose">Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court.

<l gn="874" n="28" form="prose">Most shallow man! Thou worm&#8217;s-meat, in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Touchstone">TOUCH.</speaker>
<l gn="878" n="32" form="prose">That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match.

Yet I profess curing it by counsel.</l>

<speaker long="Rosalind (as Ganymede)" alias="GAN.">ROS.</speaker>
<l gn="1043" n="197" form="prose">Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me. At which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every passion something, and for no passion truly any thing, as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this color; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his mad humor of love to a living humor of madness, which was, to forswear the full stream of the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cur&#8217;d him, and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep&#8217;s heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in&#8217;t.</l>

Courage! As horns are odious, they are necessary. It is said, &#8220;Many a man knows no end of his goods.&#8221; Right! Many a man has good horns, and knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife, &#8217;tis none of his own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no, the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore bless&#8217;d? No, as a wall&#8217;d town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor; and by how much defense is better than no skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to want.</l>

Troilus had his brains dash&#8217;d out with a Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love. Leander, he would have liv&#8217;d many a fair year though Hero had turn&#8217;d nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and being taken with the cramp was drown&#8217;d; and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was&#8212;Hero of Sestos.

<l gn="1701" n="47" form="prose">Upon a lie seven times remov&#8217;d (bear your body more seeming, Audrey), as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier&#8217;s beard. He sent me word, if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was: this is call&#8217;d the Retort Courteous. If I sent him word again, it was not well cut, he would send me word he cut it to please himself: this is call&#8217;d the Quip Modest. If again, it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment: this is call&#8217;d the Reply Churlish. If again, it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true: this is call&#8217;d the Reproof Valiant. If again, it was not well cut, he would say I lie: this is call&#8217;d the Countercheck Quarrelsome; and so to Lie Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.</l>

<l gn="1705" n="51" form="prose">O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book&#8212;as you have books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fift, the Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixt, the Lie with Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as, &#8220;If you said so, then I said so&#8221;; and they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the only peacemaker; much virtue in If.</l>
