<line globalnumber="1" number="1" form="prose">As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeath&#8217;d me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say&#8217;st, charg&#8217;d my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or (to speak more properly) stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better, for besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly hir&#8217;d; but I (his brother) gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</line>

Your brother is but young and tender, and for your love I would be loath to foil him, as I must for my own honor if he come in; therefore out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search, and altogether against my will.</line>

I&#8217;ll tell thee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man&#8217;s good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother; therefore use thy discretion&#8212; I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to&#8217;t; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practice against thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta&#8217;en thy life by some indirect means or other; for I assure thee (and almost with tears I speak it) there is not one so young and so villainous this day living.

<line globalnumber="857" number="12" form="prose">Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in respect that it is a shepherd&#8217;s life, it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vild life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life (look you) it fits my humor well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Corin">COR.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="858" number="13" form="prose">No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content is without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath learn&#8217;d no wit by nature, nor art, may complain of good breeding, or comes of a very dull kindred.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Touchstone">TOUCH.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="865" number="20" form="prose">Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw&#8217;st good manners; if thou never saw&#8217;st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Corin">COR.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="866" number="21" form="prose">Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands; that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.</line>

<line globalnumber="873" number="28" form="prose">Most shallow man! Thou worm&#8217;s-meat, in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Touchstone">TOUCH.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="877" number="32" form="prose">That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match.

<line globalnumber="1042" number="197" form="prose">Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me. At which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every passion something, and for no passion truly any thing, as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this color; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his mad humor of love to a living humor of madness, which was, to forswear the full stream of the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cur&#8217;d him, and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep&#8217;s heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in&#8217;t.</line>

Well, that is the dowry of his wife, &#8217;tis none of his own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no, the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore bless&#8217;d? No, as a wall&#8217;d town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor; and by how much defense is better than no skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to want.</line>

Troilus had his brains dash&#8217;d out with a Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love. Leander, he would have liv&#8217;d many a fair year though Hero had turn&#8217;d nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and being taken with the cramp was drown&#8217;d; and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was&#8212;Hero of Sestos.

<line globalnumber="1451" number="87" form="verse">When last the young Orlando parted from you</line>
<line globalnumber="1452" number="88" form="verse">He left a promise to return again</line>
<line globalnumber="1453" number="89" form="verse">Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,</line>
<line globalnumber="1454" number="90" form="verse">Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,</line>
<line globalnumber="1455" number="91" form="verse">Lo what befell! He threw his eye aside,</line>
<line globalnumber="1456" number="92" form="verse">And mark what object did present itself</line>
<line globalnumber="1457" number="93" form="verse">Under an old oak, whose boughs were moss&#8217;d with age</line>
<line globalnumber="1458" number="94" form="verse">And high top bald with dry antiquity:</line>
<line globalnumber="1459" number="95" form="verse">A wretched ragged man, o&#8217;ergrown with hair,</line>
<line globalnumber="1460" number="96" form="verse">Lay sleeping on his back; about his neck</line>
<line globalnumber="1461" number="97" form="verse">A green and gilded snake had wreath&#8217;d itself,</line>

<line globalnumber="1467" number="103" form="verse">A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,</line>
<line globalnumber="1468" number="104" form="verse">Lay couching, head on ground, with cat-like watch</line>
<line globalnumber="1469" number="105" form="verse">When that the sleeping man should stir; for &#8217;tis</line>
<line globalnumber="1470" number="106" form="verse">The royal disposition of that beast</line>
<line globalnumber="1471" number="107" form="verse">To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.</line>

<line globalnumber="1483" number="118" form="verse">And nature, stronger than his just occasion,</line>
<line globalnumber="1484" number="119" form="verse">Made him give battle to the lioness,</line>

Know of me then (for now I speak to some purpose) that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are; neither do I labor for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things. I have, since I was three year old, convers&#8217;d with a magician, most profound in his art, and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries Aliena, shall you marry her. I know into what straits of fortune she is driven, and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow, human as she is, and without any danger.</line>

I press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favor&#8217;d thing, sir, but mine own; a poor humor of mine, sir, to take that that no man else will.

<line globalnumber="1695" number="47" form="prose">Upon a lie seven times remov&#8217;d (bear your body more seeming, Audrey), as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier&#8217;s beard. He sent me word, if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was: this is call&#8217;d the Retort Courteous. If I sent him word again, it was not well cut, he would send me word he cut it to please himself: this is call&#8217;d the Quip Modest. If again, it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment: this is call&#8217;d the Reply Churlish. If again, it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true: this is call&#8217;d the Reproof Valiant. If again, it was not well cut, he would say I lie: this is call&#8217;d the Countercheck Quarrelsome; and so to Lie Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.</line>

<line globalnumber="1699" number="51" form="prose">O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book&#8212;as you have books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fift, the Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixt, the Lie with Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as, &#8220;If you said so, then I said so&#8221;; and they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the only peacemaker; much virtue in If.</line>

What a case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not furnish&#8217;d like a beggar, therefore to beg will not become me. My way is to conjure you, and I&#8217;ll begin with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of this play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love you bear to women (as I perceive by your simp&#8217;ring, none of you hates them), that between you and the women the play may please. If I were a woman I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleas&#8217;d me, complexions that lik&#8217;d me, and breaths that I defied not; and I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths, will for my kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</line>
