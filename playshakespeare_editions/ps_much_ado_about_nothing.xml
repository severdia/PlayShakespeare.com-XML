<line globalnumber="5" number="5" form="prose">A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestow&#8217;d much honor on a young Florentine call&#8217;d Claudio.</line>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="6" number="6" form="prose">Much deserv&#8217;d on his part, and equally rememb&#8217;red by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed better bett&#8217;red expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.</line>

<line globalnumber="17" number="17" form="prose">He set up his bills here in Messina, and challeng&#8217;d Cupid at the flight, and my uncle&#8217;s fool, reading the challenge, subscrib&#8217;d for Cupid, and challeng&#8217;d him at the burbolt. I pray you, how many hath he kill&#8217;d and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he kill&#8217;d? For indeed I promis&#8217;d to eat all of his killing.</line>

<line globalnumber="24" number="24" form="prose">It is so indeed, he is no less than a stuff&#8217;d man. But for the stuffing&#8212;well, we are all mortal.</line>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="25" number="25" form="prose">You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war betwixt <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick and her; they never meet but there&#8217;s a skirmish of wit between them.</line>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="26" number="26" form="prose">Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man govern&#8217;d with one; so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse, for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.</line>

<line globalnumber="28" number="28" form="prose">Very easily possible. He wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat: it ever changes with the next block.</line>

<line globalnumber="30" number="30" form="prose">No, and he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?</line>
</speech>
<speech>

</speech>
<speech>

<line globalnumber="32" number="32" form="prose">O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease; he is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere &#8217;a be cur&#8217;d.</line>

I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe; I have known when he would have walk&#8217;d ten mile afoot to see a good armor, and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet; he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose (like an honest man and a soldier), and now is he turn&#8217;d orthography&#8212;his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not. I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster, but I&#8217;ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that&#8217;s certain; wise, or I&#8217;ll none; virtuous, or I&#8217;ll never cheapen her; fair, or I&#8217;ll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what color it please God. Hah! The Prince and <foreign xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</foreign> Love. I will hide me in the arbor.</line>

I hear how I am censur&#8217;d; they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her; they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry. I must not seem proud; happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair; &#8217;tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; &#8217;tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have rail&#8217;d so long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter?

In brief, since I do purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it, and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruis&#8217;d, and love my cousin.</line>
