</sp>
<sp>

<l gn="5" n="5" form="prose">A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestow&#8217;d much honor on a young Florentine call&#8217;d Claudio.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<l gn="6" n="6" form="prose">Much deserv&#8217;d on his part, and equally rememb&#8217;red by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed better bett&#8217;red expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<l gn="17" n="17" form="prose">He set up his bills here in Messina, and challeng&#8217;d Cupid at the flight, and my uncle&#8217;s fool, reading the challenge, subscrib&#8217;d for Cupid, and challeng&#8217;d him at the burbolt. I pray you, how many hath he kill&#8217;d and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he kill&#8217;d? For indeed I promis&#8217;d to eat all of his killing.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>

</sp>
<sp>

<l gn="19" n="19" form="prose">He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l gn="20" n="20" form="prose">You had musty victual, and he hath help to eat it. He is a very valiant trencherman, he hath an excellent stomach.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<l gn="25" n="25" form="prose">You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war betwixt  Benedick and her; they never meet but there&#8217;s a skirmish of wit between them.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<l gn="26" n="26" form="prose">Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man govern&#8217;d with one; so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse, for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.</l>
</sp>

<l gn="29" n="29" form="prose">I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<l gn="30" n="30" form="prose">No, and he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<l gn="31" n="31" form="prose">He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<l gn="32" n="32" form="prose">O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease; he is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere &#8217;a be cur&#8217;d.</l>

She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the Prince&#8217;s jester, that I was duller than a great thaw, huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her, she would infect to the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endow&#8217;d with all that Adam had left him before he transgress&#8217;d. She would have made Hercules have turn&#8217;d spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire too. Come, talk not of her; you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary, and people sin upon purpose, because they would go thither; so indeed all disquiet, horror, and perturbation follows her.</l>

I hear how I am censur&#8217;d; they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her; they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry. I must not seem proud; happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair; &#8217;tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; &#8217;tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have rail&#8217;d so long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humor? No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day, she&#8217;s a fair lady.

<l gn="643" n="9" form="prose">You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favor, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it, and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince&#8217;s name.</l>

<speaker long="Dogberry">DOG.</speaker>
<l gn="647" n="13" form="prose">True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince&#8217;s subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to talk, is most tolerable, and not to be endur&#8217;d.</l>

<l gn="655" n="21" form="prose">Truly by your office you may, but I think they that touch pitch will be defil&#8217;d. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him show himself what he is, and steal out of your company.</l>
