Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently, for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear apassion to totters, to very rags, to spleet the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipt for o&#8217;erdoing Termagant, it out-Herods Herod, pray you avoid it.</l>

Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special observance, that you o&#8217;erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so o&#8217;erdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as &#8217;twere the mirror up to nature: to show virtue her feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it makes the unskillful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of which one must in your allowance o&#8217;erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play&#8212;and heard others praise, and that highly&#8212;not to speak it profanely, that, neither having th&#8217; accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellow&#8217;d that I have thought some of Nature&#8217;s journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.</l>
