<speech>
<speaker long="Parolles">PAR.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="81" number="77">Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up. Marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost, may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. &#8217;Tis too cold a companion; away with&#8217;t!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Helena">HEL.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="82" number="78">I will stand for&#8217;t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Parolles">PAR.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="83" number="79">There&#8217;s little can be said in&#8217;t, &#8217;tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself, and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not, you cannot choose but lose by&#8217;t. Out with&#8217;t! Within t&#8217; one year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal itself not much the worse. Away with&#8217;t!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Helena">HEL.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="84" number="80">How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Parolles">PAR.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="85" number="81">Let me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne&#8217;er it likes. &#8217;Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying: the longer kept, the less worth. Off with&#8217;t while &#8217;tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly suited, but unsuitable&#8212;just like the brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French wither&#8217;d pears, it looks ill, it eats drily, marry, &#8217;tis a wither&#8217;d pear; it was formerly better, marry, yet &#8217;tis a wither&#8217;d pear.

<line globalnumber="1296" number="5">Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he&#8217;s a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship&#8217;s entertainment.</line>

<line globalnumber="1300" number="9">I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy. We will bind and hoodwink him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at his examination, if he do not, for the promise of his life, and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you, and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my judgment in any thing.</line>
