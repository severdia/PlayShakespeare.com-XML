<l gn="29" n="29" form="verse">Why thou departedst from thy native home,</l>
<l gn="30" n="30" form="verse">And for what cause thou cam&#8217;st to Ephesus.</l>

<sp>
<speaker long="Egeon">EGE.</speaker>
<l gn="31" n="31" form="verse">A heavier task could not have been impos&#8217;d</l>
<l gn="32" n="32" form="verse">Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:</l>
<l gn="33" n="33" form="verse">Yet that the world may witness that my end</l>
<l gn="34" n="34" form="verse">Was wrought by nature, not by vile offense,</l>
<l gn="35" n="35" form="verse">I&#8217;ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.</l>
<l gn="36" n="36" form="verse">In Syracuse was I born, and wed</l>
<l gn="37" n="37" form="verse">Unto a woman, happy but for me,</l>
<l gn="38" n="38" form="verse">And by me, had not our hap been bad:</l>
<l gn="39" n="39" form="verse">With her I liv&#8217;d in joy; our wealth increas&#8217;d</l>
<l gn="40" n="40" form="verse">By prosperous voyages I often made</l>
<l gn="41" n="41" form="verse">To Epidamium, till my factor&#8217;s death,</l>
<l gn="42" n="42" form="verse">And the great care of goods at random left,</l>
<l gn="43" n="43" form="verse">Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;</l>
<l gn="44" n="44" form="verse">From whom my absence was not six months old</l>
<l gn="45" n="45" form="verse">Before herself (almost at fainting under</l>
<l gn="46" n="46" form="verse">The pleasing punishment that women bear)</l>
<l gn="47" n="47" form="verse">Had made provision for her following me,</l>
<l gn="48" n="48" form="verse">And soon, and safe, arrived where I was.</l>
<l gn="49" n="49" form="verse">There had she not been long but she became</l>
<l gn="50" n="50" form="verse">A joyful mother of two goodly sons:</l>
<l gn="51" n="51" form="verse">And, which was strange, the one so like the other</l>
<l gn="52" n="52" form="verse">As could not be distinguish&#8217;d but by names.</l>
<l gn="53" n="53" form="verse">That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</l>
<l gn="54" n="54" form="verse">A mean woman was delivered</l>
<l gn="55" n="55" form="verse">Of such a burden male, twins both alike.</l>
<l gn="56" n="56" form="verse">Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,</l>
<l gn="57" n="57" form="verse">I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.</l>
<l gn="58" n="58" form="verse">My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</l>
<l gn="59" n="59" form="verse">Made daily motions for our home return:</l>
<l gn="60" n="60" form="verse">Unwilling I agreed. Alas! Too soon</l>
<l gn="61" n="61" form="verse">We came aboard.</l>
<l gn="62" n="62" form="verse">A league from Epidamium had we sail&#8217;d</l>
<l gn="63" n="63" form="verse">Before the always-wind-obeying deep</l>
<l gn="64" n="64" form="verse">Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</l>
<l gn="65" n="65" form="verse">But longer did we not retain much hope;</l>
<l gn="66" n="66" form="verse">For what obscured light the heavens did grant</l>
<l gn="67" n="67" form="verse">Did but convey unto our fearful minds</l>
<l gn="68" n="68" form="verse">A doubtful warrant of immediate death,</l>
<l gn="69" n="69" form="verse">Which though myself would gladly have embrac&#8217;d,</l>
<l gn="70" n="70" form="verse">Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</l>
<l gn="71" n="71" form="verse">Weeping before for what she saw must come,</l>
<l gn="72" n="72" form="verse">And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</l>
<l gn="73" n="73" form="verse">That mourn&#8217;d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</l>
<l gn="74" n="74" form="verse">Forc&#8217;d me to seek delays for them and me.</l>
<l gn="75" n="75" form="verse">And this it was (for other means was none):</l>
<l gn="76" n="76" form="verse">The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</l>
<l gn="77" n="77" form="verse">And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.</l>
<l gn="78" n="78" form="verse">My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</l>
<l gn="79" n="79" form="verse">Had fast&#8217;ned him unto a small spare mast,</l>
<l gn="80" n="80" form="verse">Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;</l>
<l gn="81" n="81" form="verse">To him one of the other twins was bound,</l>
<l gn="82" n="82" form="verse">Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.</l>
<l gn="83" n="83" form="verse">The children thus dispos&#8217;d, my wife and I,</l>
<l gn="84" n="84" form="verse">Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix&#8217;d,</l>
<l gn="85" n="85" form="verse">Fast&#8217;ned ourselves at either end the mast,</l>
<l gn="86" n="86" form="verse">And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</l>
<l gn="87" n="87" form="verse">Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</l>
<l gn="88" n="88" form="verse">At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</l>
<l gn="89" n="89" form="verse">Dispers&#8217;d those vapors that offended us,</l>
<l gn="90" n="90" form="verse">And by the benefit of his wished light</l>
<l gn="91" n="91" form="verse">The seas wax&#8217;d calm, and we discovered</l>
<l gn="92" n="92" form="verse">Two ships from far, making amain to us,</l>
<l gn="93" n="93" form="verse">Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.</l>
<l gn="94" n="94" form="rhyme">But ere they came&#8212;O, let me say no more!</l>
<l gn="95" n="95" form="rhyme">Gather the sequel by that went before.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Solinus, Duke of Ephesus">DUKE.</speaker>
<l gn="96" n="96" form="verse">Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so,</l>
<l gn="97" n="97" form="verse">For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Egeon">EGE.</speaker>
<l gn="98" n="98" form="verse">O, had the gods done so, I had not now</l>
<l gn="99" n="99" form="verse">Worthily term&#8217;d them merciless to us!</l>
<l gn="100" n="100" form="verse">For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</l>
<l gn="101" n="101" form="verse">We were encount&#8217;red by a mighty rock,</l>
<l gn="102" n="102" form="verse">Which being violently borne upon,</l>
<l gn="103" n="103" form="verse">Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</l>
<l gn="104" n="104" form="verse">So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</l>
<l gn="105" n="105" form="verse">Fortune had left to both of us alike</l>
<l gn="106" n="106" form="verse">What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</l>
<l gn="107" n="107" form="verse">Her part, poor soul! Seeming as burdened</l>
<l gn="108" n="108" form="verse">With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,</l>
<l gn="109" n="109" form="verse">Was carried with more speed before the wind,</l>
<l gn="110" n="110" form="verse">And in our sight they three were taken up</l>
<l gn="111" n="111" form="verse">By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</l>
<l gn="112" n="112" form="verse">At length, another ship had seiz&#8217;d on us,</l>
<l gn="113" n="113" form="verse">And knowing whom it was their hap to save,</l>
<l gn="114" n="114" form="verse">Gave healthful welcome to their shipwrack&#8217;d guests,</l>
<l gn="115" n="115" form="verse">And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</l>
<l gn="116" n="116" form="verse">Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</l>
<l gn="117" n="117" form="verse">And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</l>
<l gn="118" n="118" form="verse">Thus have you heard me sever&#8217;d from my bliss,</l>
<l gn="119" n="119" form="verse">That by misfortunes was my life prolong&#8217;d,</l>
<l gn="120" n="120" form="verse">To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</l>
</sp>
