I have sold all my trompery; not a counterfeit stone, not a ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad, knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, to keep my pack from fasting. They throng who should buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallow&#8217;d and brought a benediction to the buyer; by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture, and what I saw, to my good use I rememb&#8217;red. My clown (who wants but something to be a reasonable man) grew so in love with the wenches&#8217; song, that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words, which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears. You might have pinch&#8217;d a placket, it was senseless; &#8217;twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse; I would have fil&#8217;d keys off that hung in chains. No hearing, no feeling, but my sir&#8217;s song, and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this time of lethargy I pick&#8217;d and cut most of their festival purses; and had not the old man come in with a whoobub against his daughter and the King&#8217;s son, and scar&#8217;d my choughs from the chaff, I had not left a purse alive in the whole army.</l>

The mantle of Queen Hermione&#8217;s; her jewel about the neck of it; the letters of Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his character; the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother; the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding; and many other evidences proclaim her, with all certainty, to be the King&#8217;s daughter.

There was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment, not by favor. Our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cries, &#8220;O, thy mother, thy mother!&#8221;; then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his daughter with clipping her. Now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings&#8217; reigns.

But O, the noble combat that &#8217;twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina! She had one eye declin&#8217;d for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle was fulfill&#8217;d.
