You were wont, when you laugh&#8217;d, to crow like a cock; when you walk&#8217;d, to walk like one of the lions; when you fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you look&#8217;d sadly, it was for want of money: and now you are metamorphis&#8217;d with a mistress, that when I look on you, I can hardly think you my master.</l>

He is a stone, a very pebble stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog. A Jew would have wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam, having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I&#8217;ll show you the manner of it. This shoe is my father; no, this left shoe is my father; no, no, this left shoe is my mother; nay, that cannot be so neither; yes, it is so, it is so&#8212;it hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in it, is my mother, and this my father&#8212;a vengeance on&#8217;t! There &#8217;tis. Now, sir, this staff is my sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand. This hat is Nan, our maid. I am the dog&#8212;no, the dog is himself, and I am the dog&#8212;O! The dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so, so. Now come I to my father: &#8220;Father, your blessing.&#8221; Now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping; now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother. O that she could speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there &#8217;tis; here&#8217;s my mother&#8217;s breath up and down. Now come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes.

<l gn="729" n="2" form="prose">Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not welcome. I reckon this always, that a man is never undone till he be hang&#8217;d, nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess say &#8220;Welcome.&#8221;</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l gn="730" n="3" form="prose">Come on, you madcap, I&#8217;ll to the alehouse with you presently; where, for one shot of five pence, thou shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how did thy master part with Madam Julia?</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l gn="731" n="4" form="prose">Marry, after they clos&#8217;d in earnest, they parted very fairly in jest.</l>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Launce">LAUNCE.</speaker>
<l gn="735" n="8" form="prose">No, neither.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

</sp>

</sp>
<sp>

<l gn="744" n="17" form="prose">It stands under thee indeed.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Speed">SPEED.</speaker>
<l gn="748" n="21" form="prose">The conclusion is then, that it will.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Launce">LAUNCE.</speaker>
<l gn="749" n="22" form="prose">Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.</l>

<l gn="751" n="24" form="prose">I never knew him otherwise.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l gn="752" n="25" form="prose">Than how?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Launce">LAUNCE.</speaker>
<l gn="753" n="26" form="prose">A notable lubber&#8212;as thou reportest him to be.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l gn="754" n="27" form="prose">Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistak&#8217;st me.</l>

<l gn="755" n="28" form="prose">Why, fool, I meant not thee, I meant thy master.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l gn="756" n="29" form="prose">I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Launce">LAUNCE.</speaker>
<l gn="757" n="30" form="prose">Why, I tell thee, I care not, though he burn himself in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse; if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the name of a Christian.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Speed">SPEED.</speaker>
<l gn="758" n="31" form="prose">Why?</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Launce">LAUNCE.</speaker>
<l gn="759" n="32" form="prose">Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?</l>

<l gn="982" n="89" form="verse">Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:</l>
<l gn="983" n="90" form="verse">Dumb jewels often in their silent kind</l>
<l gn="984" n="91" form="verse">More than quick words do move a woman&#8217;s mind.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l gn="985" n="92" form="verse">But she did scorn a present that I sent her.</l>

<sp>
<speaker long="Valentine">VAL.</speaker>
<l gn="986" n="93" form="verse">A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.</l>
<l gn="987" n="94" form="verse">Send her another; never give her o&#8217;er,</l>
<l gn="988" n="95" form="verse">For scorn at first makes after-love the more.</l>
<l gn="989" n="96" form="verse">If she do frown, &#8217;tis not in hate of you,</l>
<l gn="990" n="97" form="verse">But rather to beget more love in you.</l>
<l gn="991" n="98" form="verse">If she do chide, &#8217;tis not to have you gone,</l>
<l gn="992" n="99" form="verse">For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.</l>
<l gn="993" n="100" form="verse">Take no repulse, what ever she doth say;</l>
<l gn="994" n="101" form="verse">For &#8220;get you gone,&#8221; she doth not mean &#8220;away!&#8221;</l>
<l gn="995" n="102" form="verse">Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;</l>
<l gn="996" n="103" form="verse">Though ne&#8217;er so black, say they have angels&#8217; faces.</l>
<l gn="997" n="104" form="verse">That man that hath a tongue, I say is no man,</l>
<l gn="998" n="105" form="verse">If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Duke of Milan">DUKE.</speaker>

<l gn="1010" n="117" form="verse">Why then a ladder, quaintly made of cords,</l>
<l gn="1011" n="118" form="verse">To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,</l>
<l gn="1012" n="119" form="verse">Would serve to scale another Hero&#8217;s tow&#8217;r,</l>

<l gn="1253" n="35" form="verse">Ay, if his enemy deliver it;</l>
<l gn="1254" n="36" form="verse">Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken</l>

<l gn="1257" n="39" form="verse">And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:</l>
<l gn="1258" n="40" form="verse">&#8217;Tis an ill office for a gentleman,</l>

<l gn="1265" n="47" form="verse">By aught that I can speak in his dispraise,</l>
<l gn="1266" n="48" form="verse">She shall not long continue love to him.</l>
<l gn="1267" n="49" form="verse">But say this weed her love from Valentine,</l>
<l gn="1268" n="50" form="verse">It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.</l>

<l gn="1269" n="51" form="verse">Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,</l>
<l gn="1270" n="52" form="verse">Lest it should ravel and be good to none,</l>
<l gn="1271" n="53" form="verse">You must provide to bottom it on me;</l>
<l gn="1272" n="54" form="verse">Which must be done by praising me as much</l>

<l gn="1276" n="58" form="verse">You are already Love&#8217;s firm votary,</l>

<l gn="1283" n="65" form="verse">To hate young Valentine and love my friend.</l>
</sp>
<sp>

<l gn="1284" n="66" form="verse">As much as I can do, I will effect.</l>
<l gn="1285" n="67" form="verse">But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;</l>
<l gn="1286" n="68" form="verse">You must lay lime to tangle her desires</l>
<l gn="1287" n="69" form="verse">By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes</l>
<l gn="1288" n="70" form="verse">Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker long="Duke of Milan">DUKE.</speaker>
<l gn="1289" n="71" form="verse">Ay, much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.</l>

<l gn="1294" n="76" form="verse">That may discover such integrity:</l>
<l gn="1295" n="77" form="verse">For Orpheus&#8217; lute was strung with poets&#8217; sinews,</l>
<l gn="1296" n="78" form="verse">Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,</l>
<l gn="1297" n="79" form="verse">Make tigers tame, and huge leviathans</l>
<l gn="1298" n="80" form="verse">Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.</l>

<l gn="1301" n="83" form="verse">With some sweet consort; to their instruments</l>
<l gn="1302" n="84" form="verse">Tune a deploring dump&#8212;the night&#8217;s dead silence</l>

<l gn="1576" n="1" form="prose">When a man&#8217;s servant shall play the cur with him, look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I sav&#8217;d from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it. I have taught him, even as one would say precisely, &#8220;Thus I would teach a dog.&#8221; I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon&#8217;s leg. O, &#8217;tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have (as one should say) one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been hang&#8217;d for&#8217;t; sure as I live he had suffer&#8217;d for&#8217;t. You shall judge: he thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentleman-like dogs, under the Duke&#8217;s table. He had not been there (bless the mark!) a pissing-while, but all the chamber smelt him. &#8220;Out with the dog,&#8221; says one. &#8220;What cur is that?&#8221; says another. &#8220;Whip him out,&#8221; says the third. &#8220;Hang him up,&#8221; says the Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs: &#8220;Friend,&#8221; quoth I, &#8220;you mean to whip the dog?&#8221; &#8220;Ay, marry, do I,&#8221; quoth he. &#8220;You do him the more wrong,&#8221; quoth I, &#8220;&#8217;twas I did the thing you wot of.&#8221; He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay, I&#8217;ll be sworn, I have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stol&#8217;n, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath kill&#8217;d, otherwise he had suffer&#8217;d for&#8217;t. Thou think&#8217;st not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick you serv&#8217;d me, when I took my leave of Madam Silvia. Did not I bid thee still mark me, and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman&#8217;s farthingale? Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?</l>
