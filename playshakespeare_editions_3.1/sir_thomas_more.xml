<scenelocation>London. A street.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(John Lincoln, Bettses, Francis de Barde, Doll, Caveler, Williamson, Sherwin)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>Enter, at one end, John Lincoln, with the two Bettses together; at the other end, enters Francis de Barde and Doll a lusty woman, he haling her by the arm.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Whether wilt thou hale me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BARDE.</speaker>
<line>Whether I please; thou art my prize, and I plead purchase of thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Purchase of me? Away, ye rascal! I am an honest plain carpenters wife, and though I have no beauty to like a husband, yet whatsoever is mine scorns to stoop to a stranger. Hand off, then, when I bid thee!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BARDE.</speaker>
<line>Go with me quietly, or I&#8217;ll compel thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Compel me, ye dog&#8217;s face! Thou thinkst thou hast the goldsmith&#8217;s wife in hand, whom thou enticed&#8217;st from her husband with all his plate, and when thou turnd&#8217;st her home to him again, mad&#8217;st him, like an ass, pay for his wife&#8217;s board.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BARDE.</speaker>
<line>So will I make thy husband too, if please me.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Caveler with a pair of doves; Williamson the carpenter, and Sherwin following him.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Here he comes himself; tell him so, if thou dar&#8217;st.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAVELER.</speaker>
<line>Follow me no further; I say thou shalt not have them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WILLIAMSON.</speaker>
<line>I bought them in Cheapside, and paid my money for them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHERWIN.</speaker>
<line>He did, sir, indeed; and you offer him wrong, both to take them from him, and not restore him his money neither.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAVELER.</speaker>
<line>If he paid for them, let it suffice that I possess them. Beefs and brews may serve such hinds. Are pigeons meat for a coarse carpenter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>It is hard when Englishmen&#8217;s patience must be thus jetted on by strangers, and they not dare to revenge their own wrongs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>Lincoln, let&#8217;s beat them down, and bear no more of these abuses.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>We may not, Betts. Be patient, and hear more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>How now, husband! What, one stranger take they food from thee, and another thy wife! By our Lady, flesh and blood, I think, can hardly brook that.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>Will this gear never be otherwise? Must these wrongs be thus endured?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>Let us step in, and help to revenge their injury.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BARDE.</speaker>
<line>What art thou that talkest of revenge? My lord ambassador shall once more make your Major have a check, if he punish thee for this saucy presumption.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WILLIAMSON.</speaker>
<line>Indeed, my lord Mayor, on the ambassador&#8217;s complaint, sent me to Newgate one day, because (against my will) I took the wall of a stranger. You may do any thing; the goldsmith&#8217;s wife and mine now must be at your commandment.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>The more patient fools are ye both, to suffer it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BARDE.</speaker>
<line>Suffer it! Mend it thou or he, if ye can or dare. I tell thee, fellows, and she were the Mayor of London&#8217;s wife, had I her once in my possession, I would keep her in spite of him that durst say nay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>I tell thee, Lombard, these words should cost thy best cape, were I not curbed by duty and obedience. The Mayor of London&#8217;s wife! Oh God, shall it be thus?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Why, Betts, am not I as dear to my husband as my lord Mayor&#8217;s wife to him? And wilt thou so neglectly suffer thine own shame?&#8212;Hands off, proud stranger! Or, by him that bought me, if men&#8217;s milky hearts dare not strike a stranger, yet women beat them down, ere they bear these abuses.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BARDE.</speaker>
<line>Mistress, I say you shall along with me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Touch not Doll Williamson, least she lay thee along on God&#8217;s dear earth.</line>
<stagedir>To Caveler</stagedir>
<line>And you, sir, that allow such coarse cates to carpenters, whilst pigeons, which they pay for, must serve your dainty appetite, deliver them back to my husband again, or I&#8217;ll call so many women to mine assistance as will not leave one inch untorn of thee. If our husbands must be bridled by law, and forced to bear your wrongs, their wives will be a little lawless, and soundly beat ye.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAVELER.</speaker>
<line>Come away, De Barde, and let us go complain to my lord ambassador.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Ambo.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Aye, go, and send him among us, and we&#8217;ll give him his welcome too. I am ashamed that freeborn Englishmen, having beaten strangers within their own homes, should thus be braved and abused by them at home.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHERWIN.</speaker>
<line>It is not our lack of courage in the cause, but the strict obedience that we are bound to. I am the goldsmith whose wrongs you talked of; but how to redress yours or mine own is a matter beyond our abilities.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>Not so, not so, my good friends. I, though a mean man, a broker by profession, and named John Lincoln, have long time winked at these wild enormities with mighty impatience, and, as these two brethren here (Betts by name) can witness, with loss of mine own life would gladly remedy them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>And he is in a good forwardness, I tell ye, if all hit right.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>As how, I prithee? Tell it to Doll Williamson.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>You know the Spittle sermons begin the next week. I have drawn a bill of our wrongs and the strangers&#8217; insolences.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>Which he means the preachers shall there openly publish in the pulpit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WILLIAMSON.</speaker>
<line>Oh, but that they would! I&#8217;faith, it would tickle our strangers thoroughly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Aye, and if you men durst not undertake it, before God, we women would. Take an honest woman from her husband! Why, it is intolerable.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHERWIN.</speaker>
<line>But how find ye the preachers affected to our proceeding?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>Master Doctor Standish hath answered that it becomes not him to move any such thing in his sermon, and tells us we must move the Mayor and aldermen to reform it, and doubts not but happy success will ensue on statement of our wrongs. You shall perceive there&#8217;s no hurt in the bill. Here&#8217;s a couple of it; I pray ye, hear it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>With all our hearts; for God&#8217;s sake, read it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<stagedir>Reads.</stagedir>
<line><recite>&#8220;To you all, the worshipful lords and masters of this city, that will take compassion over the poor people your neighbors, and also of the great importable hurts, losses, and hinderances, whereof proceedeth extreme poverty to all the king&#8217;s subjects that inhabit within this city and suburbs of the same. For so it is that aliens and strangers eat the bread from the fatherless children, and take the living from all the artificers and the intercourse from all the merchants, whereby poverty is so much increased, that every man bewaileth the misery of other; for craftsmen be brought to beggary, and merchants to neediness. Wherefore, the premises considered, the redress must be of the common knit and united to one part. And as the hurt and damage grieveth all men, so must all men see to their willing power for remedy, and not suffer the said aliens in their wealth, and the natural born men of this region to come to confusion.&#8221;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Before God, &#8217;tis excellent; and I&#8217;ll maintain the suit to be honest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHERWIN.</speaker>
<line>Well, say &#8217;tis read, what is your further meaning in the matter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>What? Marry, list to me. No doubt but this will store us with friends enow, whose names we will closely keep in writing; and on May day next in the morning we&#8217;ll go forth a Maying, but make it the worst May day for the strangers that ever they saw. How say ye? Do ye subscribe, or are ye faint-hearted revolters?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Hold thee, George Betts, there&#8217;s my hand and my heart. By the Lord, I&#8217;ll make a captain among ye, and do somewhat to be talk of forever after.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WILLIAMSON.</speaker>
<line>My masters, ere we part, let&#8217;s friendly go and drink together, and swear true secrecy upon our lives.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>There spake an angel. Come, let us along, then.</line>

<scenepersonae>(Lord Mayor, Justice Suresby, Justices, Sheriff More, Sheriff, Smart, Lifter, Recorder, Officers)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>An arras is drawn, and behind it as in sessions sit the Lord Mayor, Justice Suresby, and other Justices; Sheriff More and the other Sheriff sitting by. Smart is the plaintiff, Lifter the prisoner at the bar. Recorder, Officers.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>Having dispatched our weightier businesses,</line>
<line>We may give ear to petty felonies.</line>
<line>Master Sheriff More, what is this fellow?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>My lord, he stands indicted for a purse;</line>
<line>He hath been tried, the jury is together.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>Who sent him in?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line offset="4">That did I, my lord:</line>
<line>Had he had right, he had been hanged ere this;</line>
<line>The only captain of the cutpurse crew.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>What is his name?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>As his profession is, Lifter, my lord,</line>
<line>One that can lift a purse right cunningly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>And is that he accuses him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>The same, my lord, whom, by your honors leave,</line>
<line>I must say somewhat too, because I find</line>
<line>In some respects he is well worthy blame.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>Good Master Justice Suresby, speak your mind;</line>
<line>We are well pleased to give you audience.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>Hear me, Smart; thou art a foolish fellow:</line>
<line>If Lifter be convicted by the law,</line>
<line>As I see not how the jury can acquit him,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll stand too &#8217;t thou art guilty of his death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>My lord, that&#8217;s worthy the hearing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Listen, then, good Master More.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>I tell thee plain, it is a shame for thee,</line>
<line>With such a sum to tempt necessity;</line>
<line>No less than ten pounds, sir, will serve your turn,</line>
<line>To carry in your purse about with ye,</line>
<line>To crake and brag in taverns of your money:</line>
<line>I promise ye, a man that goes abroad</line>
<line>With an intent of truth, meeting such a booty,</line>
<line>May be provoked to that he never meant.</line>
<line>What makes so many pilferers and felons,</line>
<line>But such fond baits that foolish people lay</line>
<line>To tempt the needy miserable wretch?</line>
<line>Ten pounds, odd money; this is a pretty sum</line>
<line>To bear about, which were more safe at home.</line>
<line>&#8217;Fore God, &#8217;twere well to fine ye as much more</line>
<stagedir>Lord Mayor and More whisper.</stagedir>
<line>To the relief of the poor prisoners,</line>
<line>To teach ye be more careful of your own,</line>
<line>In sooth, I say ye were but rightly served,</line>
<line>If ye had lost as much as twice ten pounds.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Good my lord, sooth a point or two for once,</line>
<line>Only to try conclusions in this case.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>Content, good Master More. We&#8217;ll rise awhile,</line>
<line>And, till the jury can return their verdict,</line>
<line>Walk in the garden. How say ye, Justices?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>We like it well, my lord; we&#8217;ll follow ye.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Lord Mayor and Justices.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Nay, plaintiff, go you too;&#8212;and officers,</line>
<stagedir>Exeunt Smart.</stagedir>
<line>Stand you aside, and leave the prisoner</line>
<line>To me awhile. Lifter, come hither.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>What is your worship&#8217;s pleasure?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Sirrah, you know that you are known to me,</line>
<line>And I have often saved ye from this place,</line>
<line>Since first I came in office. Thou seest beside,</line>
<line>That Justice Suresby is thy heavy friend,</line>
<line>By all the blame that he pretends to Smart,</line>
<line>For tempting thee with such a sum of money.</line>
<line>I tell thee what; devise me but a means</line>
<line>To pick or cut his purse, and, on my credit,</line>
<line>And as I am a Christian and a man,</line>
<line>I will procure they pardon for that jest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>Good Master Sheriff, seek not my overthrow:</line>
<line>You know, sir, I have many heavy friends,</line>
<line>And more indictments like to come upon me.</line>
<line>You are too deep for me to deal withal;</line>
<line>You are known to be one of the wisest men</line>
<line>That is in England. I pray ye, Master Sheriff,</line>
<line>Go not about to undermine my life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Lifter, I am true subject to my king;</line>
<line>Thou much mistak&#8217;st me. And, for thou shall not think</line>
<line>I mean by this to hurt thy life at all,</line>
<line>I will maintain the act when thou hast done it.</line>
<line>Thou knowest there are such matters in my hands,</line>
<line>As if I pleased to give them to the jury,</line>
<line>I should not need this way to circumvent thee.</line>
<line>All that I aim at is a merry jest:</line>
<line>Perform it, Lifter, and expect my best.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>I thank your worship. God preserve your life!</line>
<line>But Master Justice Suresby is gone in;</line>
<line>I know not how to come near where he is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Let me alone for that; I&#8217;ll be thy setter;</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll send him hither to thee presently,</line>
<line>Under the colour of thine own request</line>
<line>Of private matters to acquaint him with.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>If ye do so, sir, then let me alone;</line>
<line>Forty to one but then his purse is gone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Well said. But see that thou diminish not</line>
<line>One penny of the money, but give it me;</line>
<line>It is the cunning act that credits thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>I will, good Master Sheriff, I assure ye.</line>
<stagedir>Exeunt More.</stagedir>
<line>I see the purpose of this gentleman</line>
<line>Is but to check the folly of the Justice,</line>
<line>For blaming others in a desperate case,</line>
<line>Wherein himself may fall as soon as any.</line>
<line>To save my life, it is a good adventure:</line>
<line>Silence there, ho! Now doth the Justice enter.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Justice Suresby.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>Now, sirrah, now, what is your will with me?</line>
<line>Wilt thou discharge thy conscience like an honest man?</line>
<line>What sayest to me, sirrah? Be brief, be brief.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>As brief, sir, as I can.</line>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>If ye stand fair, I will be brief anon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>Speak out, and mumble not. What sayest thou, sirrah?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I am charged, as God shall be my comfort,</line>
<line>With more than&#8217;s true.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>Sir, sir, ye are indeed, with more than&#8217;s true,</line>
<line>For you are flatly charged with felony;</line>
<line>You&#8217;re charged with more than truth, and that is theft;</line>
<line>More than a true man should be charged withal;</line>
<line>Thou art a varlet, that&#8217;s no more than true.</line>
<line>Trifle not with me; do not, do not, sirrah;</line>
<line>Confess but what thou knowest, I ask no more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>There be, sir, there be, if&#8217;t shall please your worship&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>&#8216;There be,&#8217; varlet! What be there? Tell me what there be.</line>
<line>Come off or on. &#8216;There be!&#8217; What be there, knave?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>There be, sir, diverse very cunning fellows,</line>
<line>That, while you stand and look them in the face,</line>
<line>Will have your purse.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Th&#8217;art an honest knave:</line>
<line>Tell me what are they? Where they may be caught?</line>
<line>Aye, those are they I look for.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line offset="5">You talk of me, sir;</line>
<line>Alas, I am a puny! There&#8217;s one indeed</line>
<line>Goes by my name, he puts down all for purses;</line>
<line>He&#8217;ll steal your worship&#8217;s purse under your nose.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>Ha, ha! Art thou so sure, varlet?</line>
<line>Well, well,</line>
<line>Be as familiar as thou wilt, my knave;</line>
<line>Tis this I long to know.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>And you shall have your longing ere ye go.</line>
<line>This fellow, sir, perhaps will meet ye thus,</line>
<line>Or thus, or thus, and in kind compliment</line>
<line>Pretend acquaintance, somewhat doubtfully;</line>
<line>And these embraces serve&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>Aye, marry, Lifter, wherefore serve they?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Shrugging gladly.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>Only to feel</line>
<line>Whether you go full under sail or no,</line>
<line>Or that your lading be aboard your bark.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>In plainer English, Lifter, if my purse</line>
<line>Be stored or no?</line>
</speech>

<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Ye have it, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Excellent, excellent.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>Then, sir, you cannot but for manner&#8217;s sake</line>
<line>Walk on with him; for he will walk your way,</line>
<line>Alleging either you have much forgot him,</line>
<line>Or he mistakes you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>But in this time has he my purse or no?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>Not yet, sir, fie!&#8212;</line>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir> 
<line>No, nor I have not yours.</line>
<stagedir>Enter Lord Mayor, and c.</stagedir>
<line>But now we must forbear; my lords return.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>A murrain on&#8217;t!&#8212;Lifter, we&#8217;ll more anon:</line>
<line>Aye, thou sayest true, there are shrewd knaves indeed:</line>
<stagedir>He sits down.</stagedir>
<line>But let them gull me, widgen me, rook me, fop me!</line>
<line>I&#8217;faith, i&#8217;faith, they are too short for me.</line>
<line>Knaves and fools meet when purses go:</line>
<line>Wise men look to their purses well enough.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Lifter, is it done?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line offset="4">Done, Master Sheriff; and there it is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>

<line>Then build upon my word. I&#8217;ll save thy life.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>RECORDER.</speaker>
<line>Lifter, stand to the bar:</line>
<line>The jury have returned the guilty; thou must die,</line>
<line>According to the custom. Look to it, Master Shreeve.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>Then, gentlemen, as you are wont to do,</line>
<line>Because as yet we have no burial place,</line>
<line>What charity your meaning&#8217;s to bestow</line>
<line>Toward burial of the prisoners now condemned,</line>
<line>Let it be given. There is first for me.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>Against all reason, sitting on the bench.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>Lifter, I talked with you; you have not lifted me? Ha?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIFTER.</speaker>
<line>Suspect ye me, sir? Oh, what a world is this!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>But hear ye, master Suresby; are ye sure</line>
<line>Ye had a purse about ye?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>Sure, Master Sheriff! As sure as you are there,</line>
<line>And in it seven pounds, odd money, on my faith.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Seven pounds, odd money! What, were you so mad,</line>
<line>Being a wise man and a magistrate,</line>
<line>To trust your purse with such a liberal sum?</line>
<line>Seven pounds, odd money! &#8217;Fore God, it is a shame,</line>
<line>With such a sum to tempt necessity:</line>
<line>I promise ye, a man that goes abroad</line>
<line>With an intent of truth, meeting such a booty,</line>
<line>May be wrought to that he never thought.</line>
<line>What makes so many pilferers and felons,</line>
<line>But these fond baits that foolish people lay</line>
<line>To tempt the needy miserable wretch?</line>
<line>Should he be taken now that has your purse,</line>
<line>I&#8217;d stand to&#8217;t, you are guilty of his death;</line>
<line>For, questionless, he would be cast by law.</line>
<line>Twere a good deed to fine ye as much more,</line>
<line>To the relief of the poor prisoners,</line>
<line>To teach ye lock your money up at home.</line>

<line>Nay, ye shall see, sir, trusting thus your money,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line>My lord of Surrey, and Sir Thomas Palmer</line>
<line>Might I with patience tempt your grave advice,</line>
<line>I tell ye true, that in these dangerous times</line>
<line>I do not like this frowning vulgar brow:</line>
<line>My searching eye did never entertain</line>
<line>A more distracted countenance of grief</line>
<line>Than I have late observed</line>
<line>In the displeased commons of the city.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis strange that from his princely clemency,</line>
<line>So well a tempered mercy and a grace,</line>
<line>To all the aliens in this fruitful land,</line>
<line>That this high-crested insolence should spring</line>
<line>From them that breathe from his majestic bounty,</line>
<line>That, fattened with the traffic of our country,</line>
<line>Already leaps into his subjects&#8217; face.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PALMER.</speaker>
<line>Yet Sherwin, hindered to commence his suit</line>
<line>Against De Barde by the ambassador,</line>
<line>By supplication made unto the king,</line>
<line>Who having first enticed away his wife,</line>
<line>And got his plate, near worth four hundred pound,</line>
<line>To grieve some wronged citizens that found</line>
<line>This vile disgrace oft cast into their teeth,</line>
<line>Of late sues Sherwin, and arrested him</line>
<line>For money for the boarding of his wife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>The more knave Barde, that, using Sherwin&#8217;s goods,</line>
<line>Doth ask him interest for the occupation.</line>
<line>I like not that, my lord of Shrewsbury:</line>
<line>He&#8217;s ill bested that lends a well-paced horse</line>
<line>Unto a man that will not find him meet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHOLMLEY.</speaker>
<line>My lord of Surrey will be pleasant still.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PALMER.</speaker>
<line>Aye, being then employed by your honors</line>
<line>To stay the broil that fell about the same,</line>
<line>Where by persuasion I enforced the wrongs,</line>
<line>And urged the grief of the displeased city,</line>
<line>He answered me, and with a solemn oath,</line>
<line>That, if he had the Mayor of London&#8217;s wife,</line>
<line>He would keep her in despite of any English.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis good, Sir Thomas, then, for you and me;</line>
<line>Your wife is dead, and I a bachelor:</line>
<line>If no man can possess his wife alone,</line>
<line>I am glad, Sir Thomas Palmer, I have none.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHOLMLEY.</speaker>
<line>If a take a wife, &#8217;a shall find her meet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>And reason good, Sir Roger Cholmley, too.</line>
<line>If these hot Frenchmen needsly will have sport,</line>
<line>They should in kindness yet defray the charge:</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis hard when men possess our wives in quiet,</line>
<line>And yet leave us in, to discharge their diet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line>My lord, our catours shall not use the market</line>
<line>For our provision, but some stranger now</line>
<line>Will take the vittailes from him he hath bought:</line>
<line>A carpenter, as I was late informed,</line>
<line>Who having bought a pair of doves in Cheap,</line>
<line>Immediately a Frenchman took them from him,</line>
<line>And beat the poor man for resisting him;</line>
<line>And when the fellow did complain his wrongs,</line>
<line>He was severely punished for his labor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>But if the English blood be once but up,</line>
<line>As I perceive their hearts already full,</line>
<line>I fear me much, before their spleens be cold,</line>
<line>Some of these saucy aliens for their pride</line>
<line>Will pay for &#8217;t soundly, wheresoe&#8217;er it lights:</line>
<line>This tide of rage that with the eddy strives,</line>
<line>I fear me much, will drown too many lives.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHOLMLEY.</speaker>
<line>Now, afore God, your honors, pardon me:</line>
<line>Men of your place and greatness are to blame.</line>
<line>I tell ye true, my lords, in that his majesty</line>
<line>Is not informed of this base abuse</line>
<line>And daily wrongs are offered to his subjects;</line>
<line>For, if he were, I know his gracious wisdom</line>
<line>Would soon redress it.</line>

<line>The city is in an uproar, and the Mayor</line>

<line>A number poor artificers are up</line>
<line>In arms and threaten to avenge their wrongs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHOLMLEY.</speaker>
<line>We feared what this would come unto:</line>
<line>This follows on the doctors publishing</line>

<line>That Doctor Beale may chance beshrew himself</line>

<line>May by his gentle and persuasive speech</line>

<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>We&#8217;ll not hear my lord of Surrey; no, no, no, no, no! Shrewsbury,</line>
<line>Shrewsbury!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Whiles they are o&#8217;er the bank of their obedience,</line>
<line>Thus will they bear down all things.</line>

<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>Sheriff More speaks; shall we hear Sheriff More speak?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Let&#8217;s hear him. &#8217;A keeps a plentyful shrievaltry, and &#8217;a made my brother Arthur Watchins Seriant Safes yeoman. Let&#8217;s hear Sheriff More.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>Sheriff More, More, More, Sheriff More!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Even by the rule you have among yourselves,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>You that have voice and credit with the number</line>
<line>Command them to a stillness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>A plague on them, they will not hold their peace; the dual cannot rule them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Then what a rough and riotous charge have you,</line>
<line>To lead those that the dual cannot rule?&#8212;</line>
<line>Good masters, hear me speak.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Aye, by th&#8217; mass, will we, More. Th&#8217; art a good housekeeper, and I thank thy good worship for my brother Arthur Watchins.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>Peace, peace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Look, what you do offend you cry upon,</line>
<line>That is, the peace. Not one of you here present,</line>
<line>Had there such fellows lived when you were babes,</line>
<line>That could have topped the peace, as now you would,</line>
<line>The peace wherein you have till now grown up</line>
<line>Had been ta&#8217;en from you, and the bloody times</line>
<line>Could not have brought you to the state of men.</line>
<line>Alas, poor things, what is it you have got,</line>
<line>Although we grant you get the thing you seek?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>Marry, the removing of the strangers, which cannot choose but much advantage the poor handicrafts of the city.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Grant them removed, and grant that this your noise</line>
<line>Hath chid down all the majesty of England;</line>
<line>Imagine that you see the wretched strangers,</line>
<line>Their babies at their backs and their poor luggage,</line>
<line>Plodding tooth ports and costs for transportation,</line>
<line>And that you sit as kings in your desires,</line>
<line>Authority quite silent by your brawl,</line>
<line>And you in ruff of your opinions clothed;</line>
<line>What had you got? I&#8217;ll tell you. You had taught</line>
<line>How insolence and strong hand should prevail,</line>
<line>How order should be quelled; and by this pattern</line>
<line>Not one of you should live an aged man,</line>
<line>For other ruffians, as their fancies wrought,</line>
<line>With self same hand, self reasons, and self right,</line>
<line>Would shark on you, and men like ravenous fishes</line>
<line>Would feed on one another.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Before God, that&#8217;s as true as the Gospel.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>Nay, this is a sound fellow, I tell you. Let&#8217;s mark him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Let me set up before your thoughts, good friends,</line>
<line>On supposition; which if you will mark,</line>
<line>You shall perceive how horrible a shape</line>
<line>Your innovation bears. First, &#8217;tis a sin</line>
<line>Which oft the apostle did forewarn us of,</line>
<line>Urging obedience to authority;</line>
<line>And &#8217;twere no error, if I told you all,</line>
<line>You were in arms against your God himself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>Marry, God forbid that!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Nay, certainly you are;</line>
<line>For to the king God hath his office lent</line>
<line>Of dread, of justice, power and command,</line>
<line>Hath bid him rule, and willed you to obey;</line>
<line>And, to add ampler majesty to this,</line>
<line>He hath not only lent the king his figure,</line>
<line>His throne and sword, but given him his own name,</line>
<line>Calls him a god on earth. What do you, then,</line>
<line>Rising &#8217;gainst him that God himself installs,</line>
<line>But rise against God? What do you to your souls</line>
<line>In doing this? O, desperate as you are,</line>
<line>Wash your foul minds with tears, and those same hands,</line>
<line>That you like rebels lift against the peace,</line>
<line>Lift up for peace, and your unreverent knees,</line>
<line>Make them your feet to kneel to be forgiven!</line>
<line>Tell me but this. What rebel captain,</line>
<line>As mutinies are incident, by his name</line>
<line>Can still the rout? Who will obey a traitor?</line>
<line>Or how can well that proclamation sound,</line>
<line>When there is no addition but a rebel</line>
<line>To qualify a rebel? You&#8217;ll put down strangers,</line>
<line>Kill them, cut their throats, possess their houses,</line>
<line>And lead the majesty of law in line,</line>
<line>To slip him like a hound. Say now the king</line>
<line>(As he is clement, if th&#8217; offender mourn)</line>
<line>Should so much come to short of your great trespass</line>
<line>As but to banish you, whether would you go?</line>
<line>What country, by the nature of your error,</line>
<line>Should give you harbor? Go you to France or Flanders,</line>
<line>To any German province, to Spain or Portugal,</line>
<line>Nay, any where that not adheres to England,&#8212;</line>
<line>Why, you must needs be strangers. Would you be pleased</line>
<line>To find a nation of such barbarous temper,</line>
<line>That, breaking out in hideous violence,</line>
<line>Would not afford you an abode on earth,</line>
<line>Whet their detested knives against your throats,</line>
<line>Spurn you like dogs, and like as if that God</line>
<line>Owed not nor made not you, nor that the claimants</line>
<line>Were not all appropriate to your comforts,</line>
<line>But chartered unto them, what would you think</line>
<line>To be thus used? This is the strangers&#8217; case;</line>
<line>And this your mountanish inhumanity.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>Faith, &#8217;a says true. Let&#8217;s do as we may be done to.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>We&#8217;ll be ruled by you, Master More, if you&#8217;ll stand our friend to procure our pardon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Submit you to these noble gentlemen,</line>
<line>Entreat their mediation to the king,</line>
<line>Give up yourself to form, obey the magistrate,</line>
<line>And there&#8217;s no doubt but mercy may be found,</line>
<line>If you so seek.</line>
<line>To persist in it is present death. But, if you</line>
<line>Yield yourselves, no doubt what punishment</line>
<line>You in simplicity have incurred, his highness</line>
<line>In mercy will most graciously pardon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>We yield, and desire his highness&#8217; mercy.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They lay by their weapons.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>No doubt his majesty will grant it you:</line>
<line>But you must yield to go to several prisons,</line>
<line>Till that his highness&#8217; will be further known.</line>

<line>My lord of Surrey, please you to take horse,</line>
<line>And ride to Cheapside, where the aldermen</line>
<line>Are with their several companies in arms;</line>
<line>Will them to go unto their several wards,</line>
<line>Both for the stay of further mutiny,</line>

<line>As shall contend.</line>

<line offset="3">I go, my noble lord.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Surrey.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line>We&#8217;ll straight go tell his highness these good news;</line>
<line>Withal, Sheriff More, I&#8217;ll tell him how your breath</line>
<line>Hath ransomed many a subject from sad death.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Shrewsbury and Cholmley.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>Lincoln and Sherwin, you shall both to Newgate;</line>
<line>The rest unto the Counters.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PALMER.</speaker>
<line>Go guard them hence. A little breath well spent</line>
<line>Cheats expectation in his fairest event.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Well, Sheriff More, thou hast done more with thy good words than all they could with their weapons. Give me thy hand, keep thy promise now for the king&#8217;s pardon, or, by the Lord, I&#8217;ll call thee a plain coney-catcher.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>Farewell, Sheriff More; and as we yield by thee,</line>
<line>So make our peace; then thou dealst honestly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>Aye, and save us from the gallows, else &#8217;a devil&#8217;s double honestly!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They are led away.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>Master Sheriff More, you have preserved the city</line>
<line>From a most dangerous fierce commotion;</line>
<line>For, if this limb of riot here in St. Martin&#8217;s</line>
<line>Had joined with other branches of the city</line>
<line>That did begin to kindle, &#8217;twould have bred</line>
<line>Great rage; that rage much murder would have fed.</line>
<line>Not steel, but eloquence hath wrought this good:</line>
<line>You have redeemed us from much threatened blood.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>My lord and brethren, what I here have spoke,</line>
<line>My country&#8217;s love, and next the city&#8217;s care,</line>
<line>Enjoined me to; which since it thus prevails,</line>
<line>Think, God hath made weak More his instrument</line>
<line>To thwart sedition&#8217;s violent intent.</line>
<line>I think &#8217;twere best, my lord, some two hours hence</line>
<line>We meet at the Guildhall, and there determine</line>
<line>That thorough every ward the watch be clad</line>
<line>In armor, but especially proud</line>
<line>That at the city gates selected men,</line>
<line>Substantial citizens, do ward tonight,</line>
<line>For fear of further mischief.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">It shall be so:</line>
<line>But yond me thinks my lord of Shrewsbury.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Shrewsbury.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line>My lord, his majesty sends loving thanks</line>
<line>To you, your brethren, and his faithful subjects,</line>
<line>Your careful citizens. But, Master More, to you</line>
<line>A rougher, yet as kind, a salutation:</line>
<line>A knights creation is this knightly steel.</line>
<line>Rise up, Sir Thomas More.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>I thank his highness for thus honoring me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line>This is but first taste of his princely favor:</line>
<line>For it hath pleased his high majesty</line>
<line>(Noting your wisdom and deserving merit)</line>
<line>To put this staff of honor in your hand,</line>
<line>For he hath chose you of his Privy Council.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>My lord, for to deny my sovereign&#8217;s bounty</line>
<line>Were to drop precious stones into the heaps</line>
<line>Whence they first came;</line>
<line>To urge my imperfections in excuse,</line>
<line>Were all as stale as custom. No, my lord,</line>
<line>My service is my kings; good reason why,&#8212;</line>
<line>Since life or death hangs on our sovereign&#8217;s eye.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>His majesty hath honored much the city</line>
<line>In this his princely choice.</line>

<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">My lord and brethren,</line>
<line>Though I depart for court my love shall rest</line>
<line>With you, as heretofore, a faithful guest.</line>
<line>I now must sleep in court, sound sleeps forbear;</line>
<line>The chamberlain to state is public care:</line>
<line>Yet, in this rising of my private blood,</line>
<line>My studious thoughts shall tend the city&#8217;s good.</line>

<line>That a record be entered of this riot,</line>

<line>To sit in person on the rest tomorrow</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Is execution yet performed?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Not yet; the carts stand ready at the stairs,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Stay, Master Sheriff; it is the council&#8217;s pleasure,</line>
<line>For more example in so bad a case,</line>
<line>A gibbet be erected in Cheapside,</line>
<line>Hard by the Standard; whether you must bring</line>
<line>Lincoln and those that were the chief with him,</line>

<stagedir>Enter Officers.</stagedir>

<line>To suffer death, and that immediately.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>It shall be done, sir.</line>
<stagedir>Exit Messenger.</stagedir>
<line offset="4">&#8212;Officers, be speedy;</line>
<line>Call for a gibbet, see it be erected;</line>
<line>Others make haste to Newgate, bid them bring</line>

<line>Away, I say, and see no time be slacked.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OFFICERS.</speaker>
<line>We go, sir.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit some severally; others set up the gibbet.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s well said, fellow; now you do your duty.</line>
<line>God for his pity help these troublous times!</line>
<line>The streets stopped up with gazing multitudes:</line>
<line>Command our armed officers with halberds</line>
<line>Make way for entrance of the prisoners;</line>
<line>Let proclamation once again be made.</line>
<line>That every householder, on pain of death,</line>
<line>Keep in his prentices, and every man</line>

<speech>
<speaker>2. OFFICER.</speaker>
<line>There&#8217;s such a press and multitude at Newgate,</line>
<line>They cannot bring the carts onto the stairs,</line>

<line>The execution is deferred till morning,</line>

<line>To chain them up, and suddenly dispatch it.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>I, for I cry lug, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>I knew the first, sir, did belong to me:</line>
<line>This the old proverb now complete doth make,</line>
<line>That &#8216;Lincoln should be hanged for London&#8217;s sake.&#8217;</line>
<stagedir>He goes up.</stagedir>
<line>I&#8217;God&#8217;s name, let us to work. Fellow, dispatch:</line>
<line>I was the foremost man in this rebellion,</line>
<line>And I the foremost that must die for it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Bravely, John Lincoln, let thy death express,</line>
<line>That, as thou liv&#8217;dst a man, thou diest no less.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>Doll Williamson, thine eyes shall witness it.</line>
<line>Then to all you that come to view mine end</line>
<line>I must confess, I had no ill intent,</line>
<line>But against such as wronged us over much:</line>
<line>And now I can perceive it was not fit</line>
<line>That private men should carve out their redress,</line>
<line>Which way they list; no, learn it now by me,&#8212;</line>
<line>Obedience is the best in each degree:</line>
<line>And asking mercy meekly of my king,</line>
<line>I patiently submit me to the law;</line>
<line>But God forgive them that were cause of it!</line>
<line>And, as a Christian, truly from my heart</line>
<line>I likewise crave they would forgive me too</line>
<line>(As freely as I do forgive their wrong)</line>
<line>That others by example of the same</line>
<line>Henceforth be warned to attempt the like</line>
<line>&#8217;Gainst any alien that repaireth hither.</line>
<line>Fare ye well, all. The next time that we meet,</line>
<line>I trust in heaven we shall each other greet.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Farewell, John Lincoln. Say all what they can,</line>
<line>Thou liv&#8217;dst a good fellow, and diedst an honest man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>Would I wear so fair on my journey! The first stretch is the worst, methinks.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Bring Williamson there forward.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Good Master Sheriff, I have an earnest suit,</line>
<line>And, as you are a man, deny&#8217;t me not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Woman, what is it? Be it in my power,</line>
<line>Thou shalt obtain it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Let me die next, sir; that is all I crave:</line>
<line>You know not what a comfort you shall bring</line>
<line>To my poor heart, to die before my husband.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Bring her to death; she shall have her desire.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>Sir, and I have a suit for you too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>What is it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>That, as you have hanged Lincoln first, and will hang her next, so you will not hang me at all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Nay, you set ope&#8217; the Counter gates, and you must hang for the folly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>Well, then, so much for it!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Sir, your free bounty much contents my mind.</line>
<line>Commend me to that good Sheriff Master More,</line>
<line>And tell him, had&#8217;t not been for his persuasion,</line>
<line>John Lincoln had not hung here as he does:</line>
<line>We would first have locked us up in Leadenhall,</line>
<line>And there been burnt to ashes with the roof.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Woman, what Master More did was a subject&#8217;s duty,</line>
<line>And hath so pleased our gracious lord the king,</line>
<line>That he is hence removed to higher place,</line>
<line>And made of council to his majesty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Well is he worthy of it, by my troth,</line>
<line>An honest, wise, well-spoken gentleman;</line>
<line>Yet would I praise his honesty much more,</line>
<line>If he had kept his word, and saved our lives:</line>
<line>But let that pass; men are but men, and so</line>
<line>Words are but words, and pays not what men owe.</line>
<line>You, husband, since perhaps the world may say</line>
<line>That through my means thou comest thus to thy end,</line>
<line>Here I begin this cup of death to thee,</line>
<line>Because thou shalt be sure to taste no worse</line>
<line>Than I have taken that must go before thee.</line>
<line>What though I be a woman? That&#8217;s no matter;</line>
<line>I do owe God a death, and I must pay him.</line>
<line>Husband, give me thy hand; be not dismayed;</line>
<line>This chair being chaired, then all our debt is paid.</line>
<line>Only two little babes we leave behind us,</line>
<line>And all I can bequeath them at this time</line>
<line>Is but the love of some good honest friend,</line>
<line>To bring them up in charitable sort:</line>
<line>What, masters! He goes upright that never halts,</line>
<line>And they may live to mend their parents&#8217; faults.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WILLIAMSON.</speaker>
<line>Why, well said, wife; i&#8217;faith, thou cheerest my heart:</line>
<line>Give me thy hand; let&#8217;s kiss, and so let&#8217;s part.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>He kisses her on the ladder.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>The next kiss, Williamson, shall be in heaven.</line>
<line>Now cheerily, lads! George Betts, a hand with thee;</line>
<line>And thine too, Rafe, and thine, good honest Sherwin.</line>
<line>Now let me tell the women of this town,</line>
<line>No stranger yet brought Doll to lying down:</line>

<line>I tell ye, Master Sheriff, you are too forward,</line>
<line>To make such haste with men unto their death;</line>
<line>I think your pains will merit little thanks,</line>
<line>Since that his highness is so merciful</line>
<line>As not to spill the blood of any subject.</line>

<line>My noble lord, would we so much had known!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>Sir Thomas More humbly upon his knee</line>
<line>Did beg the lives of all, since on his word</line>
<line>They did so gently yield. The king hath granted it,</line>
<line>And made him Lord High Chancellor of England.</line>
<line>According as he worthily deserves.</line>
<line>Since Lincoln&#8217;s life cannot be had again,</line>
<line>Then for the rest, from my dread sovereign&#8217;s lips,</line>

<line>To shun such lewd assemblies as beget</line>
<line>Unlawful riots and such traitorous acts,</line>
<line>That, striking with the hand of private hate,</line>
<line>Maim your dear country with a public wound:&#8212;</line>
<line>Oh God, that Mercy, whose majestic brow</line>
<line>Should be unwrinkled, and that awful Justice,</line>
<line>Which looketh through a vail of sufferance</line>
<line>Upon the frailty of the multitude,</line>
<line>Should with the clamours of outrageous wrongs</line>

<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>It is in heaven that I am thus and thus;</line>
<line>And that which we profanely term our fortunes</line>
<line>Is the provision of the power above,</line>
<line>Fitted and shaped just to that strength of nature</line>
<line>Which we are borne withal. Good God, good God,</line>
<line>That I from such an humble bench of birth</line>
<line>Should step as &#8217;twere up to my country&#8217;s head,</line>
<line>And give the law out there! I, in my father&#8217;s life,</line>
<line>To take prerogative and tithe of knees</line>
<line>From elder kinsmen, and him bind by my place</line>
<line>To give the smooth and dexter way to me</line>
<line>That owe it him by nature! Sure, these things,</line>
<line>Not physicked by respect, might turn our blood</line>
<line>To much corruption. But, More, the more thou hast,</line>
<line>Either of honor, office, wealth, and calling,</line>
<line>Which might excite thee to embrace and hub them,</line>
<line>The more doe thou in serpents&#8217; natures think them;</line>
<line>Fear their gay skins with thought of their sharp state;</line>
<line>And let this be thy maxim, to be great</line>
<line>Is when the thread of hayday is once &#8217;spon,</line>
<line>A bottom great wound up great undone.</line>
<line>Come on, sir. Are you ready?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>RANDALL.</speaker>
<line>Yes, my lord, I stand but on a few points; I shall have done</line>

<line>&#8217;Tis fit thou shouldst wax proud, or else thou&#8217;lt ne&#8217;er</line>
<line>Be near allied to greatness. Observe me, sirrah.</line>
<line>The learned clark Erasmus is arrived</line>
<line>Within our English court. Last night I hear</line>
<line>He feasted with our honored English poet,</line>
<line>The Earl of Surrey; and I learned today</line>
<line>The famous clark of Rotterdam will visit</line>
<line>Sir Thomas More. Therefore, sir, take my seat;</line>
<line>You are Lord Chancellor. Dress your behavior</line>
<line>According to my carriage; but beware</line>
<line>You talk not over much, for twill betray thee:</line>
<line>Who prates not much seems wise; his wit few scan;</line>
<line>While the tongue blabs tales of the imperfect man.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll see if great Erasmus can distinguish</line>
<line>Merit and outward ceremony.</line>

<line>My lord&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>There was a fray in Paternoster-row, and because they would not be parted, the street was choked up with carts.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>My noble lord, Paniar Allies throat was open.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Sirrah, hold your peace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll prove the street was not choked, but is as well as ever it was since it was a street.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>This fellow was a principal broacher of the broil.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Sblood, I broached none; it was broached and half run out, before I had a lick at it.</line>

<line>Fellow, whose man are you, that are thus lusty?</line>

<line>My name&#8217;s Jack Faulkner; I serve, next under God and my prince, Master Morris, secretary to my Lord of Winchester.</line>

<line>A fellow of your hair is very fit</line>
<line>To be a secretary&#8217;s follower!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>I hope so, my lord. The fray was between the Bishops&#8217; men of Ely and Winchester; and I could not in honor but part them. I thought it stood not with my reputation and degree to come to my questions and answers before a city justice. I knew I should to the pot.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Thou hast been there, it seems, too late already.</line>

<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>I know your honor is wise and so forth; and I desire to be only cathecized or examined by you, my noble Lord Chancellor.</line>

<line>I have worn this hair ever since I was born.</line>

<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>You know that&#8217;s not my question, but how long</line>
<line>Hath this shag fleece hung dangling on they head?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>How long, my lord? Why, sometimes thus long, sometimes lower, as the Fates and humors please.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>So quick, sir, with me, ha? I see, good fellow,</line>
<line>Thou lovest plain dealing. Sirrah, tell me now,</line>
<line>When were you last at barber&#8217;s? How long time</line>
<line>Have you upon your head worn this shag hair?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>My lord, Jack Faulkner tells no Aesop&#8217;s fables. Troth, I was not at barber&#8217;s this three years; I have not been cut not will not be cut, upon a foolish vow, which, as the Destinies shall direct, I am sworn to keep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>When comes that vow out?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>Why, when the humors are purged, not this three years.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Vows are recorded in the court of Heaven,</line>
<line>For they are holy acts. Young man, I charge thee</line>
<line>And do advise thee, start not from that vow:</line>
<line>And, for I will be sure thou shalt not shear,</line>
<line>Besides, because it is an odious sight</line>
<line>To see a man thus hairy, thou shalt lie</line>
<line>In Newgate till thy vow and thy three years</line>
<line>Be full expired. Away with him!</line>

<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>Now, great Erasmus, you approach the presence</line>
<line>Of a most worthy learned gentleman:</line>
<line>This little isle holds not a truer friend</line>
<line>Unto the arts; nor doth his greatness add</line>
<line>A feigned flourish to his worthy parts;</line>
<line>He&#8217;s great in study; that&#8217;s the statist&#8217;s grace,</line>
<line>That gains more reverence than the outward place.</line>

<speaker>ERASMUS.</speaker>
<line>Report, my lord, hath crossed the narrow seas,</line>

<line>Hath borne the fame of your Lord Chancellor:</line>

<line>I in my study oft have visited.</line>
<line>Is that Sir Thomas More?</line>

<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line offset="5">It is, Erasmus:</line>
<line>Now shall you view the honorablest scholar,</line>
<line>The most religious politician,</line>
<line>The worthiest counsellor that tends our state.</line>
<line>That study is the general watch of England;</line>
<line>In it the prince&#8217;s safety, and the peace</line>

<line offset="6">I doubt him not</line>

<line>As you proclaim him, when his meanest servants</line>

<line>Give entertainment to us at the gate</line>
<line>In Latin good phrase; what&#8217;s the master, then,</line>
<line>When such good parts shine in his meanest men?</line>

<line>Nay, sit, Erasmus;&#8212;sit, good my Lord of Surrey. I&#8217;ll make my lady</line>
<line>Come to you anon, if she will, and give you entertainment.</line>

<line>He&#8217;s ever furnished with these conceits.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RANDALL.</speaker>
<line>Yes, faith, my learned poet doth not lie for that matter. I am neither more nor less than merry Sir Thomas always. Wilt sup with me? By God, I love a parlous wise fellow that smells of a politician better than a long progress.</line>

<line>Pardon, thou reverent German, I have mixed</line>
<line>So slight a jest to the fair entertainment</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ERASMUS.</speaker>
<line>Your honor&#8217;s merry humor is best physic</line>
<line>Unto your able body; for we learn</line>
<line>Where melancholy chokes the passages</line>
<line>Of blood and breath, the erected spirit still</line>
<line>Lengthens our days with sportful exercise:</line>
<line>Study should be the saddest time of life.</line>
<line>The rest a sport exempt from thought of strife.</line>

<line>O, give not up fair poesy, sweet lord,</line>

<line>Why, this is cheerful news. Friends go and come:</line>
<line>Reverend Erasmus, who delicious words</line>
<line>Express the very soul and life of wit,</line>
<line>Newly took sad leave of me, and with tears</line>
<line>Troubled the silver channel of the Thames,</line>

<line>And on her bosom bore him toward the sea:</line>
<line>He&#8217;s gone to Rotterdam; peace go with him!</line>
<line>He left me heavy when he went from hence;</line>

<line><name type="title">The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom</name>? That, my lads;</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll none but that; the theme is very good,</line>
<line>And may maintain a liberal argument:</line>
<line>To marry wit to wisdom, asks some cunning;</line>
<line>Many have wit, that may come short of wisdom.</line>
<line>We&#8217;ll see how Master poet plays his part,</line>

<line>True, upstart fools, by sudden fortune tried,</line>
<line>Regard their former mates with naught but pride.</line>
<line>But they that cast an eye still whence they came,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>My lord, you set a gloss on London&#8217;s fame,</line>
<line>And make it happy ever by your name.</line>
<line>Needs must we say, when we remember More,</line>
<line>&#8217;Twas he that drove rebellion from our door</line>
<line>With grave discretions mild and gentle breath,</line>
<line>Shielding a many subjects&#8217; lives from death,</line>

<line>That know not I; my lord will have it so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Wife, hope the best; I am sure they&#8217;ll do their best:</line>
<line>They that would better, comes not at their feast.</line>
<line>My good Lord Cardinal&#8217;s players, I thank them for it,</line>
<line>Play us a play, to lengthen out your welcome:</line>
<line>They say it is <name type="title">The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom</name>,</line>
<line>A theme of some import, howe&#8217;er it prove;</line>
<line>But, if art fail, we&#8217;ll inch it out with love.</line>
<stagedir>Enter a Servant.</stagedir>
<line>What, are they ready?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SERVANT.</speaker>
<line>My lord, one of the players craves to speak with you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>With me? Where is he?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Inclination, the Vice, ready.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Here, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>How now! What&#8217;s the matter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>We would desire your honor but to stay a little; one of my fellows is but run to Oagles for a long beard for young Wit, and he&#8217;ll be here presently.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>A long beard for young Wit! Why, man, he may be without a beard till he come to marriage, for wit goes not all by the hair. When comes Wit in?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>In the second scene, next to the Prologue, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Why, play on till that scene come, and by that time Wit&#8217;s beard will be grown, or else the fellow returned with it. And what part playest thou?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Inclination the Vice, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Gramercies, now I may take the vice if I list. And wherefore hast thou that bridle in thy hand?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>I must be bridled anon, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>And thou beest not saddled too, it makes no matter, for then Wit&#8217;s inclination may gallop so fast, that he will outstrip Wisdom, and fall to folly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Indeed, so he does to Lady Vanity; but we have no folly in our play.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Then there&#8217;s no wit in &#8217;t, I&#8217;ll be sworn. Folly waits on wit, as the shadow on the body, and where wit is ripest there folly still is readiest. But begin, I prithee. We&#8217;ll rather allow a beardless Wit than Wit all beard to have no brain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Nay, he has his apparel on too, my lord, and therefore he is the readier to enter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Then, good Inclination, begin at a venter.</line>
<stagedir>Exit Inclination.</stagedir>
<line>My Lord Mayor,</line>
<line>Wit lacks a beard, or else they would begin:</line>
<line>I&#8217;d lend him mine, but that it is too thin.</line>
<line>Silence, they come.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>The trumpet sounds; enter the Prologue.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PROLOGUE.</speaker>
<line>Now, for as much as in these latter days,</line>
<line>Throughout the whole world in every land,</line>
<line>Vice doth increase, and virtue decays,</line>
<line>Iniquity having the upper hand;</line>
<line>We therefore intend, good gentle audience,</line>
<line>A pretty short interlude to play at this present,</line>
<line>Desiring your leave and quiet silence,</line>
<line>To show the same, as is meet and expedient,</line>
<line>It is called <name type="title">The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom</name>,</line>
<line>A matter right pithy and pleasing to hear,</line>
<line>Whereof in brief we will show the whole sum;</line>
<line>But I must be gone, for Wit doth appear.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit. Enter Wit ruffling, and Inclination the Vice.</stagedir>

<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<stagedir>Sings.</stagedir>
<line type="lyric">In an arbor green, asleep whereas I lay,</line>
<line type="lyric">The birds sang sweetly in the midst of the day,</line>
<line type="lyric">I dreamed fast of mirth and play,&#8212;</line>
<line type="lyric">In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure,</line>
<line type="lyric">Methought I walked still to and fro,</line>
<line type="lyric">And from her company I could not go;</line>
<line type="lyric">But when I waked, it was not so,&#8212;</line>
<line type="lyric">In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure.</line>
<line type="lyric">Therefore my heart is surely plight,</line>
<line type="lyric">Of her alone to have a sight,</line>
<line type="lyric">Which is my joy and heart&#8217;s delight,&#8212;</line>
<line type="lyric">In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Mark ye, my lord, this is Wit without a beard. What will he be by that time he comes to the commodity of a beard?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Oh, sir, the ground is the better on which she doth go;</line>
<line>For she will make better cheer with a little she can get,</line>
<line>Than many a one can with a great banquet of meat.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>And is her name Wisdom?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Ay, sir, a wife most fit</line>
<line>For you, my good master, my dainty sweet Wit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>To be in her company my heart it is set:</line>
<line>Therefore I prithee to let us begone;</line>
<line>For unto Wisdom Wit hath inclination.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Oh, sir, she will come her self even anon;</line>
<line>For I told her before where we would stand.</line>
<line>And then she said she would beck us with her hand.</line>
<line>Back with these boys and saucy great knaves!</line>
<stagedir>Flourishing a dagger.</stagedir>
<line>What, stand ye here so big in your braves?</line>
<line>My dagger about your coxcombs shall walk,</line>
<line>If I may but so much as hear ye chat or talk.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>But will she take pains to come for us hither?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>I warrant ye; therefore you must be familiar with her;</line>
<line>When she commeth in place,</line>
<line>You must her embrace</line>
<line>Somewhat handsomely,</line>
<line>Least she think it danger,</line>
<line>Because you are a stranger,</line>
<line>To come in your company.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>I warrant thee, Inclination, I will be busy:</line>
<line>Oh, how Wit longs to be in Wisdom&#8217;s company!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Lady Vanity singing, and beckoning with her hand.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>VANITY.</speaker>
<line>Come hither, come hither, come hither, come:</line>
<line>Such cheer as I have, thou shalt have some.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>This is Lady Vanity, I&#8217;ll hold my life:&#8212;</line>
<line>Beware, good Wit, you take not her to wife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>What, unknown honesty? A word in your ear.</line>
<stagedir>She offers to depart.</stagedir>
<line>You shall not be gone as yet, I swear:</line>
<line>Here&#8217;s none but friends, you need not to fray;</line>
<line>This young gentleman loves ye, therefore you must stay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>I trust in me she will think no danger,</line>
<line>For I love well the company of fair women;</line>
<line>And though to you I am a stranger,</line>
<line>Yet Wit may pleasure you now and then.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VANITY.</speaker>
<line>Who, you? Nay, you are such a holy man,</line>
<line>That to touch on you dare not be bold;</line>
<line>I think you would not kiss a young woman,</line>
<line>If one would give ye twenty pound in gold.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>Yes, in good sadness, lady, that I would:</line>
<line>I could find in my heart to kiss you in your smock.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VANITY.</speaker>
<line>My back is broad enough to bear that mock;</line>
<line>For it hath been told me many a time</line>
<line>That you would be seen in no such company as mine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>Not Wit in the company of Lady Wisdom?</line>
<line>Oh Jove, for what do I hither come?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Sir, she did this nothing else but to prove</line>
<line>Whether a little thing would you move</line>
<line>To be angry and fret:</line>
<line>What, and if one said so?</line>
<line>Let such trifling matters go</line>
<line>And with a kind kiss come out of her debt.</line>
<line>Is Luggins come yet with the beard?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Prologue Player.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PROLOGUE.</speaker>
<line>No, faith, he is not come. Alas, what shall we do?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Forsooth, we can go no further till our fellow Luggins come; for he plays Good Council, and now he should enter, to admonish Wit that this is Lady Vanity, and not Lady Wisdom.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Nay, and it be no more but so, ye shall not tarry at a stand for that; we&#8217;ll not have our play marred for lack of a little good council. Till your fellow come, I&#8217;ll give him the best council that I can. Pardon me, my Lord Mayor; I love to be merry.</line>
<line>Oh...Wit, thou art now on the bow hand,</line>
<line>And blindly in thine own opinion dost stand.</line>
<line>I tell thee, this naughty lewd Inclination</line>
<line>Does lead thee amiss in a very strange fashion:</line>
<line>This is not Wisdom, but Lady Vanity;</line>
<line>Therefore list to Good Council, and be ruled by me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>In troth, my lord, it is as right to Lugginses part as can be. Speak, Wit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Nay, we will not have our audience disappointed, if I can help it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>Art thou Good Council, and will tell me so?</line>
<line>Wouldst thou have Wit from Lady Wisdom to go?</line>
<line>Thou art some deceiver, I tell thee verily,</line>
<line>In saying that this is Lady Vanity.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Wit, judge not things by the outward show;</line>
<line>The eye oft mistakes, right well you do know:</line>
<line>Good Council assures thee upon his honesty,</line>
<line>That this is not Wisdom, but Lady Vanity.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Luggins with the beard.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Oh, my lord, he is come; now we shall go forward.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Art thou come? Well, fellow, I have hoped to save thine honesty a little. Now, if thou canst give Wit any better council than I have done, spare not. There I leave him to they mercy.</line>
<line>But by this time, I am sure, our banquet&#8217;s ready:</line>
<line>My lord and ladies, we will taste that first,</line>
<line>And then they shall begin the play again,</line>
<line>Which through the fellow&#8217;s absence, and by me,</line>
<line>Instead of helping, hath been hindered.</line>
<line>Prepare against we come. Lights there, I say!&#8212;</line>
<line>Thus fools oft times do help to mar the play.</line>

<line>Do ye hear, fellows? Would not my lord make a rare player? Oh, he would uphold a company beyond all hope, better than Mason among the king&#8217;s players! Did ye mark how extemprically he fell to the matter, and spake Lugginses part almost as it is in the very book set down?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>Peace; do ye know what ye say? My lord a player! Let us not meddle with any such matters. Yet I may be a little proud that my lord hath answered me in my part. But come, let us go, and be ready to begin the play again.</line>

<line>My lord is sent for to the court,</line>

<line>And, for he will not trouble you again,</line>
<line>By me for your reward a sends 8 angels,</line>
<line>With many thanks. But sup before you go:</line>
<line>It is his will you should be fairly entreated:</line>
<line>Follow, I pray ye.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line offset="3">This, Luggins, is your negligence;</line>
<line>Wanting Wit&#8217;s beard brought things into dislike;</line>
<line>For otherwise the play had been all seen,</line>
<line>Where now some curious citizen disgraced it,</line>
<line>And discommending it, all is dismissed.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Fore God, &#8217;a says true. But hear ye, sirs; eight angels, ha! My lord would never give eight angels more or less for twelve pence; other it should be three pounds, five pounds, or ten pounds. There&#8217;s twenty shillings wanting, sure.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line>Twenty to one, &#8217;tis so. I have a trick. My lord comes; stand aside.</line>

<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>In haste to counsel! What&#8217;s the business now,</line>
<line>That all so late his highness sends for me?&#8212;</line>
<line>What seek&#8217;st thou, fellow?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIT.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Nay, nothing:</line>
<line>Your lordship sent eight angels by your man,</line>
<line>And I have lost two of them in the rushes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Wit, look to that:&#8212;eight angels! I did send them ten. Who gave it them?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAN.</speaker>
<line>I, my lord; I had no more about me;</line>
<line>But by and by they shall rescue the rest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Well, Wit, &#8217;twas wisely done; thou play&#8217;st Wit well indeed,</line>
<line>Not to be thus deceived of thy right.</line>
<line>Am I a man, by office truly ordained</line>
<line>Equally to decide true right his own,</line>
<line>And shall I have deceivers in my house?</line>
<line>Then what avails my bounty, when such servants</line>
<line>Deceive the poor of what the Master gives?</line>
<line>Go on, and pull his coat over his ears:</line>
<line>There are too many such. Give them their right.</line>
<line>Wit, let thy fellows thank thee. &#8217;Twas well done;</line>
<line>Thou now deservest to match with Lady Wisdom.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>INCLINATION.</speaker>
<line>Well, a kind man, and more loving than many other. But I think we ha&#8217; met with the first&#8212;</line>

<stagedir>They sit.</stagedir>
<line>Upon this little board is daily scanned</line>
<line>The health and preservation of the land;</line>
<line>We the physicians that effect this good,</line>

<line>Our toil and careful watching brings the king</line>
<line>In league with slumbers, to which peace doth sing.</line>
<line>Avoid the room there!&#8212;</line>
<line>What business, lords, today?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line offset="5">This, my good lord;</line>
<line>About the entertainment of the Emperor</line>
<line>&#8217;Gainst the perfidious French into our pay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>My lords, as &#8217;tis the custom in this place</line>
<line>The youngest should speak first, so, if I chance</line>
<line>In this case to speak youngly, pardon me.</line>
<line>I will agree, France now hath her full strength,</line>
<line>As having new recovered the pale blood</line>
<line>Which war sluiced forth; and I consent to this,</line>
<line>That the conjunction of our English forces</line>
<line>With arms of Germany may soon bring</line>
<line>This prize of conquest in. But, then, my lords,</line>
<line>As in the moral hunting &#8217;twixt the lion</line>
<line>And other beasts, force joined with greed</line>
<line>Frighted the weaker sharers from their parts;</line>
<line>So, if the empire&#8217;s sovereign chance to put</line>
<line>His plea of partnership into war&#8217;s court,</line>
<line>Swords should decide the difference, and our blood</line>
<line>In private tears lament his entertainment.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line>To doubt the worst is still the wise man&#8217;s shield,</line>
<line>That arms him safely. But the world knows this,</line>
<line>The Emperor is a man of royal faith;</line>
<line>His love unto our sovereign brings him down</line>
<line>From his imperial seat, to march in pay</line>
<line>Under our English flag, and wear the cross,</line>
<line>Like some high order, on his manly breast;</line>
<line>Thus serving, he&#8217;s not master of himself,</line>
<line>But, like a colonel commanding other,</line>
<line>Is by the general over-awed himself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROCHESTER.</speaker>
<line>Yet, my good lord&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Let me conclude my speech.</line>
<line>As subjects share no portion in the conquest</line>
<line>Of their true sovereign, other than the merit</line>
<line>That from the sovereign guerdons the true subject;</line>
<line>So the good Emperor, in a friendly league</line>
<line>Of amity with England, will not soil</line>
<line>His honor with the theft of English spoil.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>There is no question but this entertainment</line>
<line>Will be most honorable, most commodious.</line>
<line>I have oft heard good captains wish to have</line>
<line>Rich soldiers to attend them, such as would fight</line>
<line>Both for their lives and livings; such a one</line>
<line>Is the good Emperor. I would to God,</line>
<line>We had ten thousand of such able men!</line>
<line>Hah, then there would appear no court, no city,</line>
<line>But, where the wars were, they would pay themselves.</line>
<line>Then, to prevent in French wars England&#8217;s loss,</line>
<line>Let German flags wave with our English cross.</line>

<speaker>ROPER.</speaker>
<line>Madame, what ails ye for to look so sad?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line>Troth, son, I know not what; I am not sick,</line>
<line>And yet I am not well. I would be merry;</line>
<line>But somewhat lies so heavy on heart,</line>
<line>I cannot choose but sigh. You are a scholar;</line>
<line>I pray ye, tell me, may one credit dreams?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROPER.</speaker>
<line>Why ask you that, dear madame?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line>Because tonight I had the strangest dream</line>
<line>That ere my sleep was troubled with. Me thought twas night,</line>
<line>And that the King and Queen went on the Thames</line>
<line>In barges to hear music. My lord and I</line>
<line>Were in a little boat me thought,&#8212;Lord, Lord,</line>
<line>What strange things live in slumbers!&#8212;and, being near,</line>
<line>We grappled to the barge that bare the king.</line>
<line>But after many pleasing voices spent</line>
<line>In that still moving music house, me though</line>
<line>The violence of the stream did sever us</line>
<line>Quite from the golden fleet, and hurried us</line>
<line>Unto the bridge, which with unused horror</line>
<line>We entered at full tide. Thence some slight shoot</line>
<line>Being carried by the waves, our boat stood still</line>
<line>Just opposite the Tower, and there it turned</line>
<line>And turned about, as when a whirl-pool sucks</line>
<line>The circled waters. Me thought that we both cried,</line>
<line>Till that we sunk. Where arm in arm we died.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROPER.</speaker>
<line>Give no respect, dear madame, to fond dreams:</line>
<line>They are but slight illusions of the blood.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line>Tell me not all are so; for often dreams</line>
<line>Are true diviners, either of good or ill:</line>

<line offset="4">Truly, and so have I:</line>
<line>Methought I saw him here in Chelsea Church,</line>
<line>Standing upon the roodloft, now defac&#8217;d;</line>

<line>It fell with him into the upper-choir,</line>

<line>Ruffles not proudly in a coat of trust,</line>
<line>Whilst, like a pawn at chess, he keeps in rank</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I will not hear thee, wife;</line>
<line>The winding labyrinth of thy strange discourse</line>
<line>Will ne&#8217;er have end. Sit still; and, my good wife,</line>
<line>Entreat thy tongue be still; or, credit me,</line>
<line>Thou shalt not understand a word we speak;</line>
<line>We&#8217;ll talk in Latin.</line>
<line><latin xml:lang="la">Humida vallis raros patitur fulminis ictus,</latin></line>
<line>More rest enjoys the subject meanly bred</line>

<line>Great men are still musicians, else the world lies;</line>
<line>They learn low strains after the notes that rise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROPER.</speaker>
<line>Good sir, be still yourself, and but remember</line>
<line>How in this general court of short-lived pleasure,</line>
<line>The world, creation is the ample food</line>
<line>That is digested in the maw of time:</line>
<line>If man himself be subject to such ruin,</line>
<line>How shall his garment, then, or the loose points</line>
<line>That tie respect unto his awful place,</line>
<line>Avoid destruction? Most honored father-in-law,</line>
<line>The blood you have bequeathed these several hearts</line>
<line>To nourish your posterity, stands firm;</line>
<line>And, as with joy you led us first to rise,</line>
<line>So with like hearts we&#8217;ll lock preferment&#8217;s eyes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Close them not, then, with tears. For that ostent</line>
<line>Gives a wet signal of your discontent.</line>
<line>If you will share my fortunes, comfort then;</line>
<line>An hundred smiles for one sigh. What! We are men:</line>
<line>Resign wet passion to these weaker eyes,</line>
<line>Which proves their sex, but grants it ne&#8217;er more wise.</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s now survey our state. Here sits my wife,</line>
<line>And dear esteemed issue; yonder stand</line>
<line>My loving servants. Now the difference</line>
<line>Twixt those and these. Now you shall hear my speak</line>
<line>Like More in melancholy. I conceive that nature</line>
<line>Hath sundry metals, out of which she frames</line>
<line>Us mortals, each in valuation</line>
<line>Outprizing other. Of the finest stuff</line>
<line>The finest features come. The rest of earth,</line>
<line>Receive base fortune even before their birth;</line>
<line>Hence slaves have their creation; and I think</line>
<line>Nature provides content for the base mind;</line>
<line>Under the whip, the burden, and the toil,</line>
<line>Their low-wrought bodies drudge in patience;</line>
<line>As for the prince in all his sweet-gorged maw,</line>
<line>And his rank flesh, that sinfully renews</line>
<line>The noon&#8217;s excess in the night&#8217;s dangerous surfeits.</line>
<line>What means or misery from our birth doth flow</line>
<line>Nature entitles to us; that we owe:</line>
<line>But we, being subject to the rack of hate,</line>
<line>Falling from happy life to bondage state,</line>
<line>Having seen better days, now know the lack</line>
<line>Of glory that once reared each high-fed back.</line>
<line>But you, that in your age did ne&#8217;er view better,</line>
<line>Challenged not fortune for your thriftless debter.</line>

<line>Sir, we have seen far better days than these.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>I was the patron of those days, and know</line>
<line>Those were but painted days, only for show.</line>

<line>You, Master Catesby, steward of my house;</line>

<line>Bribes, that make open traffic twixt the soul</line>

<speaker>CATESBY.</speaker>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="3">&#8217;Tis welcome, sir, to me</line>
<line>With all my heart. His blessed will be done!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>Your wisdom, sir, hath been so well approved,</line>
<line>And your fair patience in imprisonment</line>
<line>Hath ever shewn such constancy of mind</line>
<line>And Christian resolution in all troubles,</line>
<line>As warrant us you are not unprepared.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>No, Master Lieutenant;</line>
<line>I thank my God, I have peace of conscience,</line>
<line>Though the world and I are at a little odds:</line>
<line>But we&#8217;ll be even now, I hope, ere long.</line>
<line>When is the execution of your warrant?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>Tomorrow morning.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">So, sir, I thank ye;</line>
<line>I have not lived so ill, I fear to die.</line>
<line>Master Lieutenant, I have had a sore fit of the stone tonight; but the</line>
<line>King hath sent me such a rare receipt, I thank him, as I shall not</line>
<line>Need to fear it much.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>In life and death still merry Sir Thomas More.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Sirrah fellow, reach me the urinal:</line>
<stagedir>He gives it him.</stagedir>
<line>Ha! Let me see (there&#8217;s) gravel in the water;</line>
<line>(And yet I see no grave danger in that)</line>
<line>The man were likely to live long enough,</line>
<line>So pleased the king. Here, fellow, take it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SERVANT.</speaker>
<line>Shall I go with it to the doctor, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>No, save thy labor; we&#8217;ll cozen him of a fee:</line>
<line>Thou shalt see me take a dram tomorrow morning,</line>
<line>Shall cure the stone, I warrant; doubt it not.</line>
<line>Master Lieutenant, what news of my Lord of Rochester?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>Yesterday morning was he put to death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>The peace of soul sleep with him!</line>
<line>He was a learned and a reverend prelate,</line>
<line>And a rich man, believe me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>If he were rich, what is Sir Thomas More,</line>
<line>That all this while hath been Lord Chancellor?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Say ye so, Master Lieutenant? What do ye think</line>
<line>A man, that with my time had held my place,</line>
<line>Might purchase?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>Perhaps, my lord, two thousand pound a year.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Master Lieutenant, I protest to you,</line>
<line>I never had the means in all my life</line>
<line>To purchase one poor hundred pound a year:</line>
<line>I think I am the poorest Chancellor</line>
<line>That ever was in England, though I could wish,</line>
<line>For credit of the place, that my estate were better.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>It&#8217;s very strange.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="4">It will be found as true.</line>
<line>I think, sir, that with most part of my coin</line>
<line>I have purchased as strange commodities</line>
<line>As ever you heard tell of in your life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>Commodities, my lord!</line>
<line>Might I (without offense) inquire of them?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Croutches, Master Lieutenant, and bare cloaks;</line>
<line>For halting soldiers and poor needy scholars</line>
<line>Have had my gettings in the Chancery:</line>
<line>To think but what a cheat the crown shall have</line>
<line>By my attainder! I prithee, if thou be&#8217;est a gentleman,</line>
<line>Get but a copy of my inventory.</line>
<line>That part of poet that was given me</line>
<line>Made me a very unthrift;</line>
<line>For this is the disease attends us all,</line>
<line>Poets were never thrifty, never shall.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Lady More mourning, Daughters, Master Roper.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>Oh, noble More!&#8212;</line>
<line>My lord, your wife, your son-in-law, and daughters.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Son Roper, welcome;&#8212;welcome, wife, and girls.</line>
<line>Why do you weep? Because I live at ease?</line>
<line>Did you not see, when I was Chancellor,</line>
<line>I was so clogged with suitors every hour,</line>
<line>I could not sleep, nor dine, nor sup in quiet?</line>
<line>Here&#8217;s none of this; here I can sit and talk</line>
<line>With my honest keeper half a day together,</line>
<line>Laugh and be merry. Why, then, should you weep?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROPER.</speaker>
<line>These tears, my lord, for this your long restraint</line>
<line>Hope had dried up, with comfort that we yet,</line>
<line>Although imprisoned, might have had your life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>To live in prison, what a life were that!</line>
<line>The king (I thank him) loves me more then so.</line>
<line>Tomorrow I shall be at liberty</line>
<line>To go even whether I can,</line>
<line>After I have dispatched my business.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line>Ah, husband, husband, yet submit yourself!</line>
<line>Have care of your poor wife and children.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Wife, so I have; and I do leave you all</line>
<line>To his protection hath the power to keep you</line>
<line>Safer than I can,&#8212;</line>
<line>The father of the widow and the orphans.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROPER.</speaker>
<line>The world, my lord, hath ever held you wise;</line>
<line>And &#8217;t shall be no distaste unto your wisdom,</line>
<line>To yield to the opinion of the state.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>I have deceived myself, I must acknowledge;</line>
<line>And, as you say, son Roper, to confess the same,</line>
<line>It will be no disparagement at all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line>His highness shall be certified thereof</line>
<line>Immediately.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Offering to depart.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Nay, hear me, wife; first let me tell ye how:</line>
<line>I thought to have had a barber for my beard;</line>
<line>Now, I remember, that were labor lost,</line>
<line>The headsman now shall cut off head and all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROP. WIFE.</speaker>
<line>Father, his majesty, upon your meek submission,</line>
<line>Will yet (they say) receive you to his grace</line>
<line>In as great credit as you were before.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Has appointed me to do a little business.</line>
<line>If that were past, my girl, thou then shouldst see</line>
<line>What I would say to him about that matter;</line>
<line>But I shall be so busy until then,</line>
<line>I shall not tend it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DAUGHTER.</speaker>
<line>Ah, my dear father!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Dear lord and husband!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Be comforted, good wife, to live and love my children;</line>
<line>For with thee leave I all my care of them.</line>
<line>Son Roper, for my sake that have loved thee well,</line>
<line>And for her virtue&#8217;s sake, cherish my child.</line>
<line>Girl, be not proud, but of thy husband&#8217;s love;</line>
<line>Ever retain thy virtuous modesty;</line>
<line>That modesty is such a comely garment</line>
<line>As it is never out of fashion, sits as fair</line>
<line>Upon the meaner woman as the empress;</line>
<line>No stuff that gold can buy is half so rich,</line>
<line>Nor ornament that so becomes a woman.</line>
<line>Live all and love together, and thereby</line>
<line>You give your father a rich obsequy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH DAUGHTERS.</speaker>
<line>Your blessing, dear father.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>I must be gone&#8212;God bless you!&#8212;</line>
<line>To talk with God, who now doth call.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY MORE.</speaker>
<line>Aye, my dear husband!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Sweet wife, good night, good night:</line>
<line>God send us all his everlasting light!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROPER.</speaker>
<line>I think, before this hour,</line>
<line>More heavy hearts ne&#8217;er parted in the Tower.</line>

<stagedir>Enter the Sheriffs of London and their Officers at one door, the Warders with their halbards at another.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Officers, what time of day is&#8217;t?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. OFFICER.</speaker>
<line>Almost eight o&#8217;clock.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>We must make haste then, least we stay too long.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. WARDER.</speaker>
<line>Good morrow, Master Sheriffs of London; Master Lieutenant</line>
<line>Wills ye repair to the limits of the Tower,</line>
<line>There to receive your prisoner.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Go back, and tell his worship we are ready.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Go bid the officers make clear the way,</line>
<line>There may be passage for the prisoner.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Lieutenant and his Guard, with More.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Yet, God be thanked, here&#8217;s a fair day toward,</line>
<line>To take our journey in. Master Lieutenant,</line>
<line>It were fair walking on the Tower leads.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>And so it might have liked my sovereign lord,</line>
<line>I would to God you might have walked there still!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>He weeps.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Sir, we are walking to a better place.</line>
<line>Oh, sir, your kind and loving tears</line>
<line>Are like sweet odors to embalm your friend!</line>
<line>Thank your good lady; since I was your guest,</line>
<line>She has made me a very wanton, in good sooth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>Oh, I had hoped we should not yet have parted!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>But I must leave ye for a little while;</line>
<line>Within an hour or two you may look for me;</line>
<line>But there will be so many come to see me,</line>
<line>That I shall be so proud, I will not speak;</line>
<line>And, sure, my memory is grown so ill,</line>
<line>I fear I shall forget my head behind me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LIEUTENANT.</speaker>
<line>God and his blessed angels be about ye!&#8212;</line>
<line>Here, Master Sheriffs, receive your prisoner.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Good morrow, Master Sheriffs of London, to ye both:</line>
<line>I thank ye that ye will vouchsafe to meet me;</line>
<line>I see by this you have not quite forgot</line>
<line>That I was in times past, as you are now,</line>
<line>A sheriff of London.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Sir, then you know our duty doth require it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>I know it well, sir, else I would have been glad</line>
<line>You might have saved a labor at this time.</line>
<line>Ah, Master Sheriff, you and I have been of old acquaintance! You were a patient auditor of mine, when I read the divinity lecture at St. Lawrence&#8217;s.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Sir Thomas More, I have heard you oft,</line>
<line>As many other did, to our great comfort.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Pray God, you may so now, with all my heart!</line>
<line>And, as I call to mind,</line>
<line>When I studied the law in Lincoln&#8217;s Inn,</line>
<line>I was of council with ye in a cause.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>I was about to say so, good Sir Thomas...</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Oh, is this the place?</line>
<line>I promise ye, it is a goodly scaffold:</line>
<line>In sooth, I am come about a headless errand,</line>
<line>For I have not much to say, now I am here.</line>
<line>Well, let&#8217;s ascend, i&#8217;God&#8217;s name:</line>
<line>In troth, methinks, your stair is somewhat weak;</line>
<line>I prithee, honest friend, lend me thy hand</line>
<line>To help me up; as for my coming down,</line>
<line>Let me alone, I&#8217;ll look to that myself.</line>
<stagedir>As he is going up the stairs, enters the Earls of Surrey and Shrewsbury.</stagedir>
<line>My Lords of Surrey and Shrewsbury, give me your hands. Yet before we...ye see, though it pleaseth the king to raise me thus high, yet I am not proud, for the higher I mount, the better I can see my friends about me. I am now on a far voyage, and this strange wooden horse must bear me thither; yet I perceive by your looks you like my bargain so ill, that there&#8217;s not one of ye all dare enter with me. Truly, here&#8217;s a most sweet gallery;</line>
<stagedir>Walking.</stagedir>
<line>I like the air of it better than my garden at Chelsea. By your patience, good people, that have pressed thus into my bedchamber, if you&#8217;ll not trouble me, I&#8217;ll take a sound sleep here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line>My lord, &#8217;twere good you&#8217;ld publish to the world</line>
<line>Your great offense unto his majesty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>My lord, I&#8217;ll bequeath this legacy to the hangman,</line>
<stagedir>Gives him his gown.</stagedir>
<line>and do it instantly. I confess, his majesty hath been ever good to me; and my offense to his highness makes me of a state pleader a stage player (though I am old, and have a bad voice), to act this last scene of my tragedy. I&#8217;ll send him (for my trespass) a reverend head, somewhat bald; for it is not requisite any head should stand covered to so high majesty. If that content him not, because I think my body will then do me small pleasure, let him but bury it, and take it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>My lord, my lord, hold conference with your soul;</line>
<line>You see, my lord, the time of life is short.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>I see it, my good lord; I dispatched that business the last night. I come hither only to be let blood; my doctor here tells me it is good for the headache.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HANGMAN.</speaker>
<line>I beseech thee, my lord, forgive me!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Forgive thee, honest fellow! Why?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HANGMAN.</speaker>
<line>For your death, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>O, my death? I had rather it were in thy power to forgive me, for thou hast the sharpest action against me; the law, my honest friend, lies in thy hands now. Here&#8217;s thy fee;</line>
<stagedir>His purse.</stagedir>
<line>and, my good fellow, let my suit be dispatched presently; for &#8217;tis all one pain, to die a lingering death, and to live in the continual mill of a lawsuit. But I can tell thee, my neck is so short, that, if thou shouldst behead an hundred noblemen like myself, thou wouldst ne&#8217;er get credit by it; therefore (look ye, sir), do it handsomely, or, of my word, thou shalt never deal with me hereafter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HANGMAN.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll take an order for that, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>One thing more; take heed thou cutst not off my beard. Oh, I forgot; execution passed upon that last night, and the body of it lies buried in the Tower. Stay; is&#8217;t not possible to make a scape from all this strong guard? It is.</line>
<line>There is a thing within me, that will raise</line>
<line>And elevate my better part bove sight</line>
<line>Of these same weaker eyes; and, Master Sheriffs,</line>
<line>For all this troop of steel that tends my death,</line>
<line>I shall break from you, and fly up to heaven.</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s seek the means for this.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HANGMAN.</speaker>
<line>My lord, I pray ye, put off your doublet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Speak not so coldly to me; I am hoarse already;</line>
<line>I would be loathe, good fellow, to take more.</line>
<line>Point me the block; I ne&#8217;er was here before.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HANGMAN.</speaker>
<line>To the east side, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Then to the east</line>
<line>We go to sigh; that o&#8217;er, to sleep in rest.</line>
<line>Here More forsakes all mirth; good reason why;</line>
<line>The fool of flesh must with her frail life die.</line>
<line>No eye salute my trunk with a sad tear:</line>
<line>Our birth to heaven should be thus, void of fear.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit with Hangman, etc.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>A very learned worthy gentleman</line>
<line>Seals error with his blood. Come, we&#8217;ll to court.</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s sadly hence to perfect unknown fates,</line>
<line>Whilst he tends prograce to the state of states.</line>
