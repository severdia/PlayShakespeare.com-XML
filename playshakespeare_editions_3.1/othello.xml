<personae playtitle="Othello">

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="DUKE.">Duke of Venice</persname>
<persdescription>The Duke of Venice has more pressing concerns than the family problems of one old Senator, but he allows Brabantio to interrupt his council of war all the same. He is not taken in by the Turkish maneuvers that seem to threaten Rhodes rather than Cyprus. He is at first sympathetic to Brabantio&#8217;s plight, but when the Senator asks for the imprisonment of the very general the Duke needs to fend off the enemy, he becomes rather less adamant on that point. He attempts to reconcile Brabantio, Othello and Desdemona, but in the end tells them to take care of their own affairs.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BRA.">Brabantio</persname>
<persdescription>Brabantio is an old man and a Senator of Venice. He is a genteel racist: he has been very friendly to Othello and often invited him to his house to honor him and for the sake of hearing the tales of his life, but when his daughter runs away with the Moor, however, he is appalled, and convinced that witchcraft is the only explanation. He sues to the Duke for justice, but when Desdemona admits that she was fully complicit in her escape from her father&#8217;s house, he admits his defeat and tries to change the subject back to political affairs. He does not disguise his mortification or sorrow, but gives his daughter to Othello all the same, though in terms that essentially disown her. He is incapable of resisting a parting shot at Othello warning him of her faithlessness. His sorrow over his daughter brings about an early death.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="GRA.">Gratiano</persname>
<persdescription>Gratiano is Brabantio&#8217;s brother. He is one of the Venetians who arrive on Cyprus after Othello&#8217;s victory, in his case bringing the news of Brabantio&#8217;s death. Walking home with Lodovico he comes across the wounded Cassio and is convinced by Iago of Bianca&#8217;s likely guilt in the matter. He is shocked that Iago would raise a weapon against a woman. He appears quite taken aback at the strange world he seems to have come into, and soon the most he can do is wish torture on Iago. As the last remaining relative of Othello&#8217;s wife, he inherits all of the Moor&#8217;s wealth.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="LOD.">Lodovico</persname>
<persdescription>Lodovico is a kinsman of Brabantio&#8217;s. He leads the Venetian party that comes to Cyprus after Othello&#8217;s victory to proclaim Cassio the new governor. He is shocked to find Othello publicly shaming his wife and worries about the general&#8217;s sanity. Walking home with Desdemona&#8217;s uncle Gratiano, he comes across the wounded Cassio. He takes command on arriving at Desdemona&#8217;s bedchamber, order Othello disarmed and leading the interrogations, the answers to which he will take to inform the Senate in Venice. He is an upright, honest gentleman.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="OTH.">Othello</persname>
<persdescription>Othello is a Moor and a mercenary retained by the Venetian state. Widely travelled and experienced, he considers himself of no country until he binds himself to Desdemona. He spends nine months at peace in Venice, there being no war requiring him, during which time he is often invited to Brabantio&#8217;s, where he sings for his supper with the tale of his life and travelers&#8217; tales. These seduce Desdemona, Brabantio&#8217;s daughter, and he falls in love with her. They elope at a time when the rumors of new wars with the Turks make it likely that Othello&#8217;s services will soon be needed by Venice, and his commission to relieve Cyprus helps shield him from Brabantio&#8217;s wrath. Well into middle-age, he has a healthy self-regard, portraying himself as a man not ruled by passion. He sometimes seems incapable of speaking without using the grandiloquent language that characterizes him, and he possesses tremendous natural authority, enough that he can stop a fight with a single sentence. He is quick to discipline. He is, however, more vulnerable than he realizes: he is insecure over the age difference with his wife, as well as the fact of his race. His ancient (ensign) Iago&#8217;s suspicions about Cassio and Desdemona strike him close, especially coming from so trusted and honest a man. Desdemona&#8217;s importuning about Cassio only convinces him further of her guilt. Othello is a deeply trusting man, even to credulousness, and suspicions quickly convince him that he may be wrong to trust. Though not known for ever being angry, even in the middle of battle, his rage over possibly being betrayed is so strong that it renders him almost incoherent, sending him into a fit and persuading him to murder his wife. He insults and humiliates her publicly, even in front of her relatives, and goes so far as to strike her, either not knowing or not caring what harm he is doing to his image. That image is very important to him: even after killing his wife and discovering that he has been played like a fiddle and a fool by Iago, he insists on trying to define how he will be remembered before he commits suicide, though he betrays a certain lack of self-knowledge in his description of himself.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CAS.">Cassio</persname>
<persdescription>Cassio is a young Florentine officer in Venice&#8217;s army. Academically trained, he has had little if any real wartime experience. A gallant, courteous gentleman, perhaps too gallant with the ladies at time, he has been friendly with Othello for some time, and acted as a go-between for him and Desdemona. Othello has chosen him to be his lieutenant. He is naive, incapable of holding his liquor, and has a hair-trigger temper when drunk. When sober, however, he is friendly with everyone, though he compares people to what he has known in Florence. He holds his reputation to be his highest worth, and is crestfallen when he loses it and his position over a foolish drunken quarrel whose start he cannot even remember. Convinced by Iago&#8217;s arguments, he takes his hopes of reinstatement to the lieutenancy to Desdemona. He has a long-standing agreement with Bianca, though he finds it impossible to take seriously her hopes of marrying him and rather neglects her. He uses her easily, though, asking her to copy the mysterious handkerchief he finds in his room. Once the wars are done, he is named Governor of Cyprus by the Venetian Senate. Returning home from Bianca&#8217;s one evening before taking up his new position, he is set upon by a Venetian he does not know, and badly wounded. He is horrified when, soon after, he discovers the suspicions Othello has had of him and the extent of Iago&#8217;s villainy. It is left to him to decide what punishments will be inflicted on the man.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="IAGO.">Iago</persname>
<persdescription>Iago is an ancient (ensign) serving Othello, a battle-hardened veteran of 28 whose bluff honesty leaves him trusted and even liked by all who meet him. He is obsessed with the grubbiness of sex, to which he reduces all love, and is haunted by the thought that his wife Emilia has betrayed him with his general, Othello. He hates the latter, who has chosen an academically-trained man to be his lieutenant instead of the battle-hardened Iago. He is a master manipulator, managing to play people like puppets with ease, using his blunt honesty to convince them of what he chooses. He is also a brilliant improviser, setting his plot against Othello without having thought it fully through but able to use every occasion and person he meets to further his purpose. He can change his manner instantly depending on what&#8217;s required, whether it&#8217;s spewing filth to rouse Brabantio, trading witticisms with Desdemona, openly confessing his dissimulations to his gull Roderigo, or tentatively suggesting to Othello that he look to his wife. He is a misogynist, an abusive husband, and a racist. He leads Roderigo on for the sake of getting the latter&#8217;s money, and manages to use him as an agent to cause the disruptions required for Iago&#8217;s plot. Though he originally plans to find a way to sleep with Desdemona to repay Othello for having (as he thinks) slept with Emilia, this idea soon graduates to the full plan of having the Moor murder his wife while Iago takes care of murdering Cassio. His improvisation only fails when he makes the fatal mistake of sending Emilia to tell Othello and Desdemona of the attack on Cassio, something he could hardly fail to do. He refuses to offer any explanation for his actions when he is found out and caught.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="ROD.">Roderigo</persname>
<persdescription>Roderigo is a young man of Venice desperately in love with Desdemona, who has been rejected both by her and her father. He is completely under Iago&#8217;s spell, who milks his wallet for all it&#8217;s worth in the promise of furthering his suit to the lady. At Iago&#8217;s urging he wakes Brabantio to announce Desdemona&#8217;s flight to him, travels to Cyprus disguised in the hopes of gaining her favor, and in the end is willing to murder Cassio in the thought that this will bring him closer to his goal. He is rather brainless, somewhat cowardly, and only dimly perceives to what an extent he is Iago&#8217;s puppet. Wounded during his attempt on Cassio&#8217;s life, he is murdered by Iago to stop his mouth.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="MON.">Montano</persname>
<persdescription>Montano is the Governor of Cyprus. He sends news to the Venetian Senate of the Turkish advance towards the island. Esteemed by the Duke, he is however not considered as great a soldier as Othello, whom they send to replace him for the crisis. As he has served under the Moor and regards him highly, Montano has no complaints as to this. An upright soldier, he is an honorable gentleman, and disturbed at Cassio&#8217;s drunkenness. When he is gravely wounded by the latter, he charges Iago on his worth as a soldier to speak the truth about what happened during the quarrel. He is recovered enough to be on guard the night of Desdemona&#8217;s murder, and is one of those who responds to Emilia&#8217;s calls for help. He disarms Othello before he can do himself any harm, and chases after Iago, successfully capturing him.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="DES.">Desdemona</persname>
<persdescription>Desdemona is the daughter of the Venetian Senator Brabantio. A beautiful, happy girl, she has rejected all Venetian suitors, but is conquered by Othello&#8217;s tales of his life, and absconds from her father&#8217;s her to elope with him. Brought before the Duke and the Senate, she has the courage to stand up to her father and announce her choice to cleave to the Moor. She refuses to return to her father&#8217;s house, and requests instead to be allowed to follow Othello to the wars, partly because they have not yet consummated their marriage. She has a good wit, and enjoys sparring with Iago, having apparently grown fond of her lady-in-waiting&#8217;s husband during their voyage to Cyprus. She is also good friends with Cassio, who was her go-between to Othello when they were wooing, and is therefore more than willing to press Othello to restore him to favor. A kind and caring person, she is immediately concerned when Othello seems not well. She is rather na&#239;ve, and is shocked to discover Othello to be jealous, something he has never shown any sign of being. She also does not seem to catch on to his clear hints that she should drop the matter of Cassio. She is convinced by his tale of the magic in her missing handkerchief, and terrified by it. She blames government matters for his changed manner, not knowing of anything she can possibly have done to cause it herself. Even when publicly humiliated, she does not lose her temper, merely stating her innocence. She is capable of standing up to Othello as well when her honor is in question, but she is in the main rather passive. She trusts Iago enough to ask him for advice. She seems to judge other women by her own standards, unable to imagine that they might act otherwise than she does herself. Though she begs for her life on her deathbed, she still refuses to admit to a false guilt. With her last breath, she attempts to exonerate her husband of her murder.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="EMIL.">Emilia</persname>
<persdescription>Emilia is Iago&#8217;s wife. As Desdemona intends to follow Othello to the war, the latter requests that Emilia become his wife&#8217;s attendant. Worldly-wise and mistreated by her husband, who suspects her of infidelity and regularly humiliates her in public, she is not the happiest of women. Hopeful of her husband&#8217;s favor, she picks up Desdemona&#8217;s handkerchief when the latter lets it fall, and gives it to Iago, who has been pestering her to take it. She defends Desdemona&#8217;s honor to the hilt, even to Othello&#8217;s face, and is convinced that someone has been poisoning his mind. She speaks loudly and passionately, not using the most demure language when she is angry. She does not believe that men see women as genuine human beings, and blames husbands for most sins a woman commits, though she looks down on courtesans. When she finds Desdemona murdered by Othello, she refuses to hold her tongue, screaming for help. She is desperate for her husband to deny what Othello claims he has done, but when Iago does not, she refuses to obey him, and willingly risks death to speak the truth. She is murdered by her husband.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="BIAN.">Bianca</persname>
<persdescription>Bianca is a courtesan in Cyprus. Though she makes her living by selling her body, she is madly in love with one of her clients, Cassio, and dotes on him to excess. She hopes that he will marry her, and does not seem to realize that he laughs at her. Even when he gives her a handkerchief that she is convinced he received from another woman, she begs him to come to dinner at her house. She is arrested on suspicion of being involved in the assault on him.</persdescription>

<scenedescription>Iago tells Roderigo why he hates Othello: he sought to be his lieutenant, but the foreigner Michael Cassio was preferred. Roderigo is distraught that Desdemona, whom he loves, has run off with the Moor Othello and married him; with Iago, he rouses Desdemona&#8217;s father Brabantio, who at first simply accuses Roderigo of making mischief, but soon has to admit that his daughter is missing. Not wishing to be recognized, Iago leaves, while Brabantio rouses his servants and forms a search party to hunt down Othello.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Iago asks Othello whether he is properly married, warning that he is at risk from Brabantio and needs everything to be as legal as possible. Othello points out that he has done Venice enough service to outweigh Brabantio&#8217;s weighty position. He insists he will not hide from Brabantio&#8217;s men, but the group who arrives looking for him turns out to be headed by Cassio, who has been sent to fetch Othello to a council of war. Brabantio arrives with his men, and both parties draw swords; Iago makes sure to take on Roderigo so that no-one will guess at their friendship. Othello refuses to fight, and points out that he has just been summoned to the Duke. Hearing that the Council is in session, Brabantio decides to make his case directly to the Senate.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Duke, Senators, Officers, Sailor, First Messenger, Brabantio, Othello, Cassio, Iago, Roderigo, Desdemona, Iago, Attendants)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>The Duke and the senators look over the conflicting reports they are receiving about a Turkish fleet that seems to be aiming either for Rhodes or for Cyprus. They soon work out that the attack on Rhodes was merely a feint, and that Cyprus is the true target. Brabantio and Othello arrive; the Duke is glad to see Othello, who will lead the Venetian forces against the Turks, but Brabantio interrupts and insists on having his case against the Moor heard. He insists that Desdemona has been bewitched, and the Duke promises immediate vengeance until he hears that the accused is Othello. Things then get a bit more complicated, and Othello is asked to tell his version of what has happened. He admits to marrying Desdemona, but insists the only magic he used was telling stories of his life. Desdemona, sent for, confirms this, and explains that she now owes her obedience to her husband more than to her father. Brabantio unwillingly gives in, and begs that the subject be changed and that they get to affairs of state. Othello is commanded to leave at once for Cyprus; when the men discuss where Desdemona should stay while he is away, the lady speaks up and asks permission to follow her newly-wed husband to Cyprus. Brabantio tells Othello not to trust Desdemona, since if she is capable of betraying her father, she could do the same to her husband. Othello denies this. He entrusts Desdemona to Iago. Left alone with Roderigo, Iago bullies the young man out of his depressed insistence that he wishes to drown himself. Instead, Iago encourages him to disguise himself and follow them all to Cyprus, claiming that Desdemona will never put up with a black man for long, and that therefore Roderigo will have a chance at her when she gets bored with the novelty. Roderigo is convinced and goes to sell his lands for cash. Iago is delighted, since he tends to pillage Roderigo&#8217;s purse. He reflects on how he hates Othello, and believes that he has been cuckolded by the Moor. Hoping to destroy him if at all possible, Iago considers his options, and begins to see the outlines of a plan.</scenedescription>

Put money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an usurp&#8217;d beard. I say put money in thy purse. It cannot be long that Desdemona should continue her love to the Moor&#8212;put money in thy purse&#8212;nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration&#8212;put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills&#8212;fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida. She must change for youth; when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change, she must; therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a super-subtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself, it is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be hang&#8217;d in compassing thy joy than to be drown&#8217;d and go without her.</line>

<scenepersonae>(Montano, Gentlemen, Cassio, Second Messenger, Desdemona, Iago, Roderigo, Emilia, Attendants, Othello)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>A storm rages at sea, and the governor of Cyprus, Montano, cannot see which ships are being wrecked and which are not. News arrives that the Turkish fleet has been destroyed. Cassio arrives to inform the Cypriots that Othello is approaching, so long as he has not been lost in the storm. The next ship to arrive bears Iago and his wife Emilia, who is attending on Desdemona. Desdemona is worried about Othello, and passes the time asking Iago to give his opinion on women. Finally, Othello safely arrives. He greets everyone, and gives his instructions. Iago is left to unload the ship, but before he goes on his errand he convinces Roderigo that Desdemona is in love with the smooth, courtly Cassio. Roderigo finds this hard to believe, but Iago is insistent, and urges Roderigo to find a way to quarrel with Cassio that night, so that the latter&#8217;s lack of discipline will cause him to be dismissed, leaving Iago in his place. Roderigo falls in with the scheme. Iago&#8217;s plan is still incomplete, but he is slowly working it out, as he thinks on how he may begin to mislead Othello. He reveals that he is afraid that Cassio may have cuckolded him as well, and his aim to get into Desdemona&#8217;s bed in revenge on Othello.</scenedescription>

To love him still for prating&#8212;let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties&#8212;all which the Moor is defective in. Now for want of these requir&#8217;d conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abus&#8217;d, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and unforc&#8217;d position), who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose affection? Why, none, why, none&#8212;a slipper and subtle knave, a finder-out of occasion; that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after; a pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already.</line>

<scenedescription>Othello gives the command of the night watch to Cassio before retiring with Desdemona to consummate their marriage. Iago makes some bluff comments about Desdemona to Cassio, who replies in courtly terms, and insists that the lieutenant drink with him and some other friends. Cassio tries to beg off, pleading that he has no head for wine, but Iago convinces him. Cassio is soon blind drunk, though he insists that he is not. Iago insinuates that he gets this way very often to Montano, who is shocked that Othello should give him such a responsible position. Roderigo begins a quarrel with Cassio, and Iago manages to manipulate this into a general brawl, setting off the alarm bell. Montano and Cassio begin to duel, and Cassio gravely wounds the older man. Othello enters and angrily commands everyone to behave themselves, then asks Iago to explain what happened. Iago pretends he can&#8217;t quite work out how the fight began, but subtly points to Cassio as the one at fault; Cassio can only mumble a request for pardon rather than explain anything. Seeing how badly Montano is wounded, Othello immediately strips Cassio of his rank of lieutenant, despite his friendship for the other man. Desdemona comes to see what the matter is; Othello quiets her and leads her home while putting Iago in charge of calming the town. As he slowly sobers up, Cassio bemoans the loss of his reputation, but Iago insists this is only a small setback and encourages him to ask Desdemona to intercede for him with Othello. Left alone, Iago congratulates himself for giving such genuinely good advice to Cassio, since he will turn it to his own advantage by convincing Othello that Desdemona is pleading for Cassio out of desire for him. Roderigo appears to complain that he is almost out of money, has been beaten up, and does not see anything going well for himself, but Iago reassures him, explaining that things take time and sending him off. Iago decides to have his wife plead to Desdemona on Cassio&#8217;s behalf as well, and to make Othello see Cassio talking to Desdemona.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Desdemona, Cassio, Emilia, Othello, Iago)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Desdemona assures Cassio she will do all she can for him. Cassio leaves when he sees Othello and Iago approach, as he is too embarrassed to stay and hear Desdemona argue for him. Seeing Cassio leave, Iago mutters that he does not like this, but refuses to explain what he means to Othello; he insists that it cannot have been Cassio near Desdemona, since Cassio has no reason to look so guilty. Desdemona comes and pesters Othello about Cassio, and the general finally promises to see Cassio when she pleases after she insists she&#8217;ll give him no peace until he does so. She leaves after this fervent pleading, and Iago makes the most of the opportunity. Appearing to be reticent, he slowly expresses his worries that Cassio and Desdemona may be too familiar with each other. Othello forces him to explain what he means, and though Iago repeats that this may only be his imagination, and warns the general against jealousy, he brings Othello to believe that Desdemona and Cassio may be having an affair. So sure is Othello of Iago&#8217;s honesty that he credits his insinuations, though the sight of Desdemona leads him to doubt his own thoughts. Desdemona returns to find her husband in a very different temper from when she last saw him; when he complains of a pain on his forehead (his cuckold&#8217;s horns), she offers to bind it with her handkerchief, but he dismisses it as too small. The handkerchief falls to the floor, and Emilia picks it up, happy to have found it, since Iago has often asked her to steal it for him. She gives it to Iago, though he refuses to tell her what he plans to do with it. To himself he plans to lose the handkerchief in Cassio&#8217;s room, to become a physical proof to Othello. The general returns, distracted, unable to take his mind off his suspicions. Convincing himself, he bids farewell to his happiness, and rages at Iago, telling him to provide genuine proof of his allegations. Iago asks what sort of proof he can provide, pointing out that direct evidence would be hard to come by. He claims, however, that he recently heard Cassio speak in his sleep as if to Desdemona, and Othello takes this as proof. What&#8217;s more, says Iago, he recently saw Cassio wipe his face with the handkerchief that was Othello&#8217;s first gift to his wife. Othello swears to kill them both, and Iago vows to help him. Othello officially makes Iago his lieutenant.</scenedescription>

<scenelocation>Cyprus. Before the castle.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Desdemona, Emilia, Clown, Othello, Iago, Cassio, Bianca)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Desdemona sends the clown to fetch Cassio. She is worried about having lost her handkerchief, but Emilia does not tell her what she knows where it has gone. Still, Desdemona insists that Othello is not the jealous type, and states her determination to nag him until he restores Cassio to his position as lieutenant. Othello comes in, and when Desdemona asks him about Cassio, he claims to have a cold and asks to borrow her handkerchief. Desdemona says she doesn&#8217;t have it on her, and he tells her off for it, saying that it is a magical handkerchief, the loss of which will make him hate her. Desdemona is horrified at the thought, and Othello accuses her of losing it; she says that she simply left it at home. She tries to get him off his obsession with the handkerchief by bringing up Cassio again, but this merely enrages him until he stalks away. Desdemona is hurt, while Emilia expresses her low opinion of men. Cassio and Iago appear, Cassio asking Desdemona again for her help, but she has to explain that Othello is not himself. Iago pretends concern and goes off to find out what the matter is. Desdemona chides herself for bothering Othello when clearly some matter of state is occupying his thoughts, though Emilia is skeptical. The ladies leave. Cassio meets his lady-friend Bianca, who is angry with him for leaving her alone for so long; he asks her to take out the embroidery of the handkerchief he found in his room, and she accuses him of having a new lover. He tells her to be quiet and asks her to leave him alone, not wanting Othello to see him with a woman in case it hurts his suit. He promises to see her soon.</scenedescription>

<scenelocation>Cyprus. Before the castle.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Othello, Iago, Cassio, Bianca, Lodovico, Desdemona, and Attendants)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Iago continues to torment Othello, dropping suggestions into his ear while arguing that they are not great transgressions, which just works Othello up even more. He finally pushes Othello so far that the general becomes incoherent and finally falls down into a trance. Cassio enters and is concerned, but Iago tells him it&#8217;s merely an epileptic fit and asks him to leave. Reviving Othello, he proposes to have a chat with Cassio about Desdemona, letting Othello overhear. Othello agrees. What Iago actually does is talk to Cassio about Bianca, walking about so that Othello can only hear portions of the discussion. Cassio&#8217;s laughter as he mocks Bianca enrages Othello; even worse, Bianca herself arrives to rant at Cassio about the handkerchief, and Othello sees that Cassio has given that precious keepsake to a prostitute. Cassio runs after Bianca; Othello is now determined to kill both Cassio and Desdemona. Iago offers to take care of Cassio, recommending that Othello strangle Desdemona in her bed. Desdemona&#8217;s cousin Lodovico arrives from Venice with letters from the Senate that call Othello home and name Cassio the new governor of Cyprus. As Desdemona explains the situation to Lodovico, Othello hears her praises of Cassio and gets so worked up that he strikes out at her, to Lodovico&#8217;s amazement. When the Venetian protests and asks him to apologize to her, he merely sneers at her sarcastically, orders her to go home, and leaves himself. Lodovico worries for his wits, and Iago implies that what he saw is by no means the worst.</scenedescription>

<scenetitle>Scene 2</scenetitle>
<scenelocation>Cyprus. A room in the castle.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Othello, Emilia, Desdemona, Roderigo, Iago)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Othello questions Emilia, who swears that there is nothing between Desdemona and Cassio, but Othello refuses to believe her. He has Desdemona come in, and interrogates her, though Desdemona cannot see what it is he suspects her of. In the end he accuses her bluntly, and she protests her innocence with great dignity. He insults her callously, sneers at Emilia and leaves. Grieving, Desdemona asks Emilia to put her wedding sheets on the bed that night, and to call Iago to her. Iago comes in, feigning concern, and tries to console Desdemona while Emilia rails against whatever villain convinced Othello his wife was false. Iago tells Desdemona that it is only the cares of state that have disturbed Othello, and that things will get better. Desdemona and Emilia leave for the dinner for the Venetians. Roderigo comes to find Iago, reproaching him for not advancing his suit to Desdemona; he threatens to speak to Desdemona himself. This Iago cannot permit, for Roderigo has sent rich jewels to Desdemona that he, Iago, has taken for himself. Iago tells Roderigo that Cassio is to replace Othello on Cyprus, and that Othello is being sent farther away yet, and that therefore the only way to make sure Othello and Desdemona stay would be to kill Cassio so that he is not capable of taking on his new role. He offers to show Roderigo where the best place to lie in wait for Cassio would be; Roderigo needs more convincing, however.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Othello, Lodovico, Desdemona, Emilia, Attendants)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>After dinner, Othello leads Lodovico and his attendants to their lodgings, ordering Desdemona to go to bed and dismiss Emilia. Emilia is concerned. Desdemona remembers a maid in her parents&#8217; house who died of love, and sings a sad song that the maid had. She innocently asks Emilia if there actually are women who cheat on their husbands, and Emilia assures her that there are; when Desdemona says she would never do such a thing, Emilia replies that she might if the stakes were high enough. Emilia argues that the men are to blame if women do commit adultery, since the men do so themselves. Desdemona is shocked.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Iago places Roderigo at the right spot to kill Cassio; which one of the two dies does not much matter to Iago, who needs to be rid of both of them. When Cassio appears, Roderigo misses him; Cassio fights back and wounds Roderigo, while Iago stabs Cassio in the leg from behind. Othello hears Cassio&#8217;s cries and is delighted, thinking he is dead. Lodovico and Gratiano arrive at the scene, wondering what has happened; Iago appears as if just woken, and in the dark stabs Roderigo to death. The confusion is great, and when Bianca arrives, Iago manages to pin the blame on her and orders her arrested on suspicion of having arranged the crime. He binds up Cassio&#8217;s wounds and sends him to a doctor. Emilia arrives to find out what all the noise is about, and Iago sends her to tell Othello and Desdemona what has happened.

<scenetitle>Scene 2</scenetitle>
<scenelocation>A bedchamber in the castle.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Othello, Desdemona, Emilia, Montano, Gratiano, Iago, Lodovico, Cassio)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Othello enters the bedchamber where Desdemona lies sleeping, considering how it is necessary that she die. He kisses her, almost convincing himself not to kill her, but he steels himself to the task. His kisses wake her. He orders her to pray, informing her that she is about to die. She begs for mercy, denying all of his accusations, but he refuses to listen, and smothers her. Emilia knocks at the door, calling for Othello. Thinking that she has come to tell him of Cassio&#8217;s death, he is uncertain what to do, reluctant to let her in lest she try to speak to Desdemona. In the end he lets her in, and she blurts out her news. At that moment Desdemona calls out, and Emilia runs to her and tries to unsuccessfully to revive her. Desdemona insists that nobody did anything to her and dies. Othello calls her a liar and tells Emilia that he killed her. He tells Emilia why, and she is horrified and does not want to believe him when he says that Iago was the one who accused Desdemona. Despite Othello&#8217;s threats, she opens the door and yells out for help. Montano, Gratiano and Iago enter, and Emilia begs her husband to deny what Othello has said, but he cannot. He orders her to be quiet and go home, but she refuses, and when Othello brings out the proof of the handkerchief, she tells him that it was she who stole the handkerchief and gave it to Iago. Iago denies it, but Othello sees the truth and rushes at him; Iago stabs Emilia and runs out. The others chase after him, leaving Othello and Emilia with Desdemona&#8217;s body. He finds a spare sword in the room and arms himself with it, but does nothing as the extent of what he has done crushes him. Lodovico enters with the injured Cassio and the captured Iago. The story is unraveled, but Iago refuses to give any explanation for what he has done. Lodovico informs Othello that he must come with them to Venice, but Othello begs him to wait a moment; he explains what he has done in the state&#8217;s service, and thinking of one last example, he stabs himself. Dying, he drags himself to the bed to kiss Desdemona one last time as he dies. Lodovico plans to return to Venice, begging Cassio to make Iago suffer before he dies.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse">Roderigo meant t&#8217; have sent this damned villain;</line>

<line form="verse">Came in and satisfied him.</line>

<line form="verse" offset="4">I found it in my chamber:</line>

<line form="verse">There is besides, in Roderigo&#8217;s letter,</line>
<line form="verse">How he upbraids Iago, that he made him</line>

<line form="verse">You must forsake this room and go with us.</line>

<line form="verse">If there be any cunning cruelty</line>
<line form="verse">That can torment him much, and hold him long,</line>
<line form="verse">It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,</line>

<line form="verse">I have done the state some service, and they know&#8217;t&#8212;</line>
<line form="verse">No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,</line>
<line form="verse">When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,</line>
<line form="verse">Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,</line>
<line form="verse">Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak</line>
<line form="verse">Of one that lov&#8217;d not wisely but too well;</line>
<line form="verse">Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought,</line>
<line form="verse">Perplexed in the extreme; of one whose hand</line>

<line form="verse">Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdu&#8217;d eyes,</line>
<line form="verse">Albeit unused to the melting mood,</line>
<line form="verse">Drops tears as fast as the Arabian trees</line>
<line form="verse">Their medicinable gum. Set you down this;</line>
<line form="verse">And say besides, that in Aleppo once,</line>
<line form="verse">Where a malignant and a turban&#8217;d Turk</line>
<line form="verse">Beat a Venetian and traduc&#8217;d the state,</line>
<line form="verse">I took by th&#8217; throat the circumcised dog,</line>
