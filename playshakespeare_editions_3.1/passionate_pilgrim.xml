<stanza>

<stanzanum>I</stanzanum>
<line>When my love swears that she is made of truth,</line>
<line>I do believe her (though I know she lies)</line>
<line>That she might think me some untutor&#8217;d youth,</line>
<line>Unskillful in the world&#8217;s false forgeries.</line>
<line>Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,</line>
<line>Although I know my years be past the best,</line>
<line>I smiling credit her false-speaking tongue,</line>
<line>Outfacing faults in love with love&#8217;s ill rest.</line>
<line>But wherefore says my love that she is young?</line>
<line>And wherefore say not I that I am old?</line>
<line>O, love&#8217;s best habit&#8217;s in a soothing tongue,</line>
<line>And age in love, loves not to have years told.</line>
<couplet>Therefore I&#8217;ll lie with love, and love with me,</couplet>
<couplet>Since that our faults in love thus smother&#8217;d be.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<stanzanum>II</stanzanum>
<line>Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,</line>
<line>That like two spirits do suggest me still:</line>
<line>My better angel is a man (right fair),</line>
<line>My worser spirit a woman (color&#8217;d ill).</line>
<line>To win me soon to hell, my female evil</line>
<line>Tempteth my better angel from my side;</line>
<line>And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,</line>
<line>Wooing his purity with her fair pride.</line>
<line>And whether that my angel be turn&#8217;d fiend,</line>
<line>Suspect I may (yet not directly tell):</line>
<line>For being both to me, both to each friend,</line>
<line>I guess one angel in another&#8217;s hell:</line>
<couplet>The truth I shall not know, but live in doubt,</couplet>
<couplet>Till my bad angel fire my good one out.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<stanzanum>III</stanzanum>
<line>Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,</line>
<line>&#8217;Gainst whom the world could not hold argument,</line>
<line>Persuade my heart to this false perjury?</line>
<line>Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.</line>
<line>A woman I forswore; but I will prove,</line>
<line>Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:</line>
<line>My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;</line>
<line>Thy grace being gain&#8217;d cures all disgrace in me.</line>
<line>My vow was breath, and breath a vapor is,</line>
<line>Then thou, fair sun, that on this earth doth shine,</line>
<line>Exhal&#8217;st this vapor vow, in thee it is:</line>
<line>If broken, then it is no fault of mine.</line>
<couplet>If by me broke, what fool is not so wise</couplet>
<couplet>To break an oath, to win a paradise?</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<stanzanum>IV</stanzanum>
<line>Sweet Cytherea, sitting by a brook</line>
<line>With young Adonis, lovely, fresh, and green,</line>
<line>Did court the lad with many a lovely look,</line>
<line>Such looks as none could look but beauty&#8217;s queen.</line>
<line>She told him stories to delight his ear;</line>
<line>She show&#8217;d him favors to allure his eye;</line>
<line>To win his heart she touch&#8217;d him here and there—</line>
<line>Touches so soft still conquer chastity.</line>
<line>But whether unripe years did want conceit,</line>
<line>Or he refus&#8217;d to take her figured proffer,</line>
<line>The tender nibbler would not touch the bait,</line>
<line>But smile and jest at every gentle offer.</line>
<couplet>Then fell she on her back, fair queen, and toward:</couplet>
<couplet>He rose and ran away, ah, fool too froward!</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<stanzanum>V</stanzanum>
<line>If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?</line>
<line>O, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vowed:</line>
<line>Though to myself forsworn, to thee I&#8217;ll constant prove;</line>
<line>Those thoughts to me like oaks, to thee like osiers bowed.</line>
<line>Study his bias leaves, and makes his book thine eyes,</line>
<line>Where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend.</line>
<line>If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice:</line>
<line>Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,</line>
<line>All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder,</line>
<line>Which is to me some praise, that I thy parts admire.</line>
<line>Thine eye Jove&#8217;s lightning seems, thy voice his dreadful thunder,</line>
<line>Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.</line>
<couplet>Celestial as thou art, O, do not love that wrong:</couplet>
<couplet>To sing heaven&#8217;s praise with such an earthly tongue.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<stanzanum>VI</stanzanum>
<line>Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn,</line>
<line>And scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade,</line>
<line>When Cytherea (all in love forlorn)</line>
<line>A longing tarriance for Adonis made</line>
<line>Under an osier growing by a brook,</line>
<line>A brook where Adon us&#8217;d to cool his spleen.</line>
<line>Hot was the day, she hotter that did look</line>
<line>For his approach, that often there had been.</line>
<line>Anon he comes, and throws his mantle by,</line>
<line>And stood stark naked on the brook&#8217;s green brim.</line>
<line>The sun look&#8217;d on the world with glorious eye,</line>
<line>Yet not so wistly as this queen on him.</line>
<couplet>He spying her, bounc&#8217;d in, whereas he stood;</couplet>
<couplet>&#8220;O Jove,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;why was not I a flood?&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<stanzanum>VII</stanzanum>
<line>Fair is my love, but not so fair as fickle,</line>
<line>Mild as a dove, but neither true nor trusty,</line>
<line>Brighter than glass, and yet as glass is brittle,</line>
<line>Softer than wax, and yet as iron rusty:</line>
<couplet>A lily pale, with damask dye to grace her,</couplet>
<couplet>None fairer, nor none falser to deface her.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Her lips to mine how often hath she joined,</line>
<line>Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing!</line>
<line>How many tales to please me hath she coined,</line>
<line>Dreading my love, the loss whereof still fearing!</line>
<couplet>Yet in the mids of all her pure protestings,</couplet>
<couplet>Her faith, her oaths, her tears, and all were jestings.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>She burnt with love, as straw with fire flameth,</line>
<line>She burnt out love, as soon as straw out-burneth;</line>
<line>She fram&#8217;d the love, and yet she foil&#8217;d the framing,</line>
<line>She bade love last, and yet she fell a-turning.</line>
<couplet>Was this a lover, or a lecher whether?</couplet>
<couplet>Bad in the best, though excellent in neither.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<stanzanum>VIII</stanzanum>
<line>If music and sweet poetry agree,</line>
<line>As they must needs (the sister and the brother),</line>
<line>Then must the love be great &#8217;twixt thee and me,</line>
<line>Because thou lov&#8217;st the one, and I the other.</line>
<line>Dowland to thee is dear, whose heavenly touch</line>
<line>Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;</line>
<line>Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is such</line>
<line>As passing all conceit, needs no defense.</line>
<line>Thou lov&#8217;st to hear the sweet melodious sound</line>
<line>That Phoebus&#8217; lute, the queen of music, makes;</line>
<line>And I in deep delight am chiefly drown&#8217;d</line>
<line>When as himself to singing he betakes.</line>
<couplet>One god is god of both (as poets feign),</couplet>
<couplet>One knight loves both, and both in thee remain.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<stanzanum>IX</stanzanum>
<line>Fair was the morn when the fair queen of love,</line>
<line>[. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ]</line>
<line>Paler for sorrow than her milk-white dove,</line>
<line>For Adon&#8217;s sake, a youngster proud and wild,</line>
<line>Her stand she takes upon a steep-up hill.</line>
<line>Anon Adonis comes with horn and hounds;</line>
<line>She, silly queen, with more than love&#8217;s good will,</line>
<line>Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds.</line>
<line>&#8220;Once,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;did I see a fair sweet youth</line>
<line>Here in these brakes deep-wounded with a boar,</line>
<line>Deep in the thigh, a spectacle of ruth!</line>
<line>See, in my thigh,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;here was the sore.&#8221;</line>
<couplet>She showed hers, he saw more wounds than one,</couplet>
<couplet>And blushing fled, and left her all alone.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<stanzanum>X</stanzanum>
<line>Sweet rose, fair flower, untimely pluck&#8217;d, soon vaded,</line>
<line>Pluck&#8217;d in the bud, and vaded in the spring!</line>
<line>Bright orient pearl, alack, too timely shaded!</line>
<line>Fair creature, kill&#8217;d too soon by death&#8217;s sharp sting!</line>
<couplet>Like a green plum that hangs upon a tree,</couplet>
<couplet>And falls (through wind) before the fall should be.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>I weep for thee, and yet no cause I have,</line>
<line>For why: thou lefts me nothing in thy will;</line>
<line>And yet thou lefts me more than I did crave,</line>
<line>For why: I craved nothing of thee still.</line>
<couplet>O yes, dear friend, I pardon crave of thee,</couplet>
<couplet>Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me.</couplet>

<stanza>
<stanzanum>XI</stanzanum>
<line>Venus, with Adonis sitting by her,</line>
<line>Under a myrtle shade began to woo him.</line>
<line>She told the youngling how god Mars did try her,</line>
<line>And as he fell to her, she fell to him.</line>
<line>&#8220;Even thus,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;the warlike god embrac&#8217;d me,&#8221;</line>
<line>And then she clipt Adonis in her arms;</line>
<line>&#8220;Even thus,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;the warlike god unlac&#8217;d me,&#8221;</line>
<line>As if the boy should use like loving charms;</line>
<line>&#8220;Even thus,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;he seized on my lips,&#8221;</line>
<line>And with her lips on his did act the seizure:</line>
<line>And as she fetched breath, away he skips,</line>
<line>And would not take her meaning nor her pleasure.</line>
<couplet>Ah, that I had my lady at this bay:</couplet>
<couplet>To kiss and clip me till I run away!</couplet>

<line>Crabbed age and youth cannot live together:</line>
<line>Youth is full of pleasance, age is full of care,</line>
<line>Youth like summer morn, age like winter weather,</line>
<line>Youth like summer brave, age like winter bare.</line>
<line>Youth is full of sport, age&#8217;s breath is short,</line>
<couplet>Youth is nimble, age is lame,</couplet>
<line>Youth is hot and bold, age is weak and cold,</line>
<couplet>Youth is wild, and age is tame.</couplet>
<line>Age, I do abhor thee, youth, I do adore thee:</line>
<couplet>O, my love, my love is young!</couplet>
<line>Age, I do defy thee. O sweet shepherd, hie thee,</line>
<couplet>For methinks thou stays too long.</couplet>

<stanzanum>XIII</stanzanum>
<line>Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good,</line>
<line>A shining gloss that vadeth suddenly,</line>
<line>A flower that dies when first it gins to bud,</line>
<line>A brittle glass that&#8217;s broken presently:</line>
<couplet>A doubtful good, a gloss, a glass, a flower,</couplet>
<couplet>Lost, vaded, broken, dead within an hour.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And as goods lost are seld or never found,</line>
<line>As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh,</line>
<line>As flowers dead lie withered on the ground,</line>
<line>As broken glass no cement can redress:</line>
<couplet>So beauty blemish&#8217;d once, forever lost,</couplet>
<couplet>In spite of physic, painting, pain, and cost.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<stanzanum>XIV</stanzanum>
<line>Good night, good rest, ah, neither be my share!</line>
<line>She bade good night that kept my rest away,</line>
<line>And daff&#8217;d me to a cabin hang&#8217;d with care,</line>
<line>To descant on the doubts of my decay.</line>
<couplet>&#8220;Farewell,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;and come again tomorrow.&#8221;</couplet>
<couplet>Fare well I could not, for I supp&#8217;d with sorrow.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Yet at my parting sweetly did she smile,</line>
<line>In scorn or friendship, nill I conster whether.</line>
<line>&#8217;T may be she joy&#8217;d to jest at my exile,</line>
<line>&#8217;T may be again, to make me wander thither:</line>
<couplet>&#8220;Wander,&#8221; a word for shadows like myself,</couplet>
<couplet>As take the pain but cannot pluck the pelf.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!</line>
<line>My heart doth charge the watch; the morning rise</line>
<line>Doth cite each moving sense from idle rest,</line>
<line>Not daring trust the office of mine eyes.</line>
<couplet>While Philomela sits and sings, I sit and mark,</couplet>
<couplet>And wish her lays were tuned like the lark.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>For she doth welcome daylight with her ditty,</line>
<line>And drives away dark dreaming night.</line>
<line>The night so pack&#8217;d, I post unto my pretty;</line>
<line>Heart hath his hope, and eyes their wished sight:</line>
<couplet>Sorrow chang&#8217;d to solace, and solace mix&#8217;d with sorrow;</couplet>
<couplet>For why, she sight, and bade me come tomorrow.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Were I with her, the night would post too soon,</line>
<line>But now are minutes added to the hours;</line>
<line>To spite me now, each minute seems a moon,</line>
<line>Yet not for me, shine sun to succor flowers!</line>
<couplet>Pack night, peep day; good day, of night now borrow:</couplet>
<couplet>Short night tonight, and length thyself tomorrow.</couplet>

<line>It was a lording&#8217;s daughter, the fairest one of three,</line>
<line>That liked of her master, as well as well might be,</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Till looking on an Englishman, the fairest that eye could see,</line>
<couplet>Her fancy fell a-turning.</couplet>
<line>Long was the combat doubtful, that love with love did fight,</line>
<line>To leave the master loveless, or kill the gallant knight:</line>
<line>To put in practice either, alas, it was a spite</line>
<couplet>Unto the silly damsel!</couplet>
<line>But one must be refused; more mickle was the pain,</line>
<line>That nothing could be used, to turn them both to gain,</line>
<line>For of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain:</line>
<couplet>Alas, she could not help it!</couplet>
<line>Thus art with arms contending was victor of the day,</line>
<line>Which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away:</line>
<line>Then lullaby, the learned man hath got the lady gay,</line>
<couplet>For now my song is ended.</couplet>

<line>On a day (alack the day!)</line>
<line>Love, whose month was ever May,</line>
<line>Spied a blossom passing fair,</line>
<line>Playing in the wanton air.</line>
<line>Through the velvet leaves the wind</line>
<line>All unseen gan passage find,</line>

<line>Wish&#8217;d himself the heavens&#8217; breath.</line>
<line>&#8220;Air,&#8221; quoth he, &#8220;thy cheeks may blow,</line>

<line>Vow (alack) for youth unmeet,</line>
<line>Youth, so apt to pluck a sweet.</line>

<line>As it fell upon a day,</line>
<line>In the merry month of May,</line>
<line>Sitting in a pleasant shade,</line>
<line>Which a grove of myrtles made,</line>
<line>Beasts did leap and birds did sing,</line>
<line>Trees did grow and plants did spring;</line>
<line>Every thing did banish moan,</line>
<line>Save the nightingale alone.</line>
<line>She, poor bird, as all forlorn,</line>
<line>Lean&#8217;d her breast up-till a thorn,</line>
<line>And there sung the dolefull&#8217;st ditty,</line>
<line>That to hear it was great pity.</line>
<line>&#8220;Fie, fie, fie,&#8221; now would she cry,</line>
<line>&#8220;Tereu, tereu,&#8221; by and by;</line>
<line>That to hear her so complain,</line>
<line>Scarce I could from tears refrain;</line>
<line>For her griefs, so lively shown,</line>
<line>Made me think upon mine own.</line>
<line>Ah, thought I, thou mourn&#8217;st in vain,</line>
<line>None takes pity on thy pain.</line>
<line>Senseless trees, they cannot hear thee,</line>
<line>Ruthless bears, they will not cheer thee.</line>
<line>King Pandion, he is dead:</line>

<line>All thy fellow birds do sing,</line>
<line>Careless of thy sorrowing.</line>

<line>Every one that flatters thee</line>

<line>Words are easy, like the wind,</line>
<line>Faithful friends are hard to find:</line>
<line>Every man will be thy friend,</line>
<line>Whilst thou hast wherewith to spend;</line>
<line>But if store of crowns be scant,</line>
<line>No man will supply thy want.</line>
<line>If that one be prodigal,</line>
<line>Bountiful they will him call;</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And with such-like flattering,</line>
<line>&#8220;Pity but he were a king!&#8221;</line>
<line>If he be addict to vice,</line>
<line>Quickly him they will entice;</line>
<line>If to women he be bent,</line>
<line>They have at commandment.</line>
<line>But if Fortune once do frown,</line>
<line>Then farewell his great renown;</line>
<line>They that fawn&#8217;d on him before</line>
<line>Use his company no more.</line>
<line>He that is thy friend indeed,</line>
<line>He will help thee in thy need:</line>
<line>If thou sorrow, he will weep;</line>
<line>If thou wake, he cannot sleep;</line>
<line>Thus of every grief in heart</line>
<line>He with thee doth bear a part.</line>
<line>These are certain signs to know</line>
<line>Faithful friend from flatt&#8217;ring foe.</line>
</stanza>
