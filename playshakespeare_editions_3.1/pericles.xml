<STAGEDIR>Enter Gower.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To sing a song that old was sung,</LINE>
<LINE>From ashes ancient Gower is come,</LINE>
<LINE>Assuming man&#8217;s infirmities,</LINE>
<LINE>To glad your ear and please your eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>It hath been sung at festivals,</LINE>
<LINE>On ember-eves and holy-ales;</LINE>
<LINE>And lords and ladies in their lives</LINE>
<LINE>Have read it for restoratives.</LINE>
<LINE>The purchase is to make men glorious,</LINE>
<LINE><LATIN lang="la">Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius</LATIN>.</LINE>
<LINE>If you, born in those latter times,</LINE>
<LINE>When wit&#8217;s more ripe, accept my rhymes,</LINE>
<LINE>And that to hear an old man sing</LINE>
<LINE>May to your wishes pleasure bring,</LINE>
<LINE>I life would wish, and that I might</LINE>
<LINE>Waste it for you like taper-light.</LINE>
<LINE>This&#8217; Antioch, then; Antiochus the Great</LINE>
<LINE>Built up this city for his chiefest seat,</LINE>
<LINE>The fairest in all Syria&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I tell you what mine authors say.</LINE>
<LINE>This king unto him took a peer,</LINE>
<LINE>Who died and left a female heir,</LINE>
<LINE>So buxom, blithe, and full of face</LINE>
<LINE>As heaven had lent her all his grace;</LINE>
<LINE>With whom the father liking took,</LINE>
<LINE>And her to incest did provoke&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Bad child, worse father, to entice his own</LINE>
<LINE>To evil should be done by none.</LINE>
<LINE>But custom what they did begin</LINE>
<LINE>Was with long use account&#8217;d no sin.</LINE>
<LINE>The beauty of this sinful dame</LINE>
<LINE>Made many princes thither frame</LINE>
<LINE>To seek her as a bedfellow,</LINE>
<LINE>In marriage pleasures playfellow;</LINE>
<LINE>Which to prevent he made a law,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep her still and men in awe,</LINE>
<LINE>That whoso ask&#8217;d her for his wife,</LINE>
<LINE>His riddle told not, lost his life.</LINE>
<LINE>So for her many a wight did die,</LINE>
<LINE>As yon grim looks do testify.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Points to the heads of the unsuccessful suitors, displayed above.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye</LINE>
<LINE>I give my cause, who best can justify.</LINE>

<SCENELOCATION>Antioch. A room in the palace.</SCENELOCATION>
<SCENEPERSONAE>(Antiochus, Prince Pericles, Followers, Daughter of Antiochus, Thaliard, Antiochan Messenger)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Antiochus, Prince Pericles, and Followers.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Young Prince of Tyre, you have at large received</LINE>
<LINE>The danger of the task you undertake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have, Antiochus, and with a soul</LINE>
<LINE>Embold&#8217;ned with the glory of her praise,</LINE>
<LINE>Think death no hazard in this enterprise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Music.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride</LINE>
<LINE>For embracements even of Jove himself;</LINE>
<LINE>At whose conception, till Lucina reigned,</LINE>
<LINE>Nature this dowry gave: to glad her presence,</LINE>
<LINE>The senate-house of planets all did sit,</LINE>
<LINE>To knit in her their best perfections.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Antiochus&#8217; Daughter.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See where she comes, apparelled like the spring,</LINE>
<LINE>Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king</LINE>
<LINE>Of every virtue gives renown to men!</LINE>
<LINE>Her face the book of praises, where is read</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence</LINE>
<LINE>Sorrow were ever ras&#8217;d, and testy wrath</LINE>
<LINE>Could never be her mild companion.</LINE>
<LINE>You gods that made me man, and sway in love,</LINE>
<LINE>That have inflam&#8217;d desire in my breast</LINE>
<LINE>To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree</LINE>
<LINE>(Or die in th&#8217; adventure), be my helps,</LINE>
<LINE>As I am son and servant to your will,</LINE>
<LINE>To compass such a boundless happiness!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prince Pericles&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That would be son to great Antiochus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,</LINE>
<LINE>With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>For death-like dragons here affright thee hard.</LINE>
<LINE>Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view</LINE>
<LINE>Her countless glory, which desert must gain;</LINE>
<LINE>And which without desert because thine eye</LINE>
<LINE>Presumes to reach, all the whole heap must die.</LINE>
<LINE>Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,</LINE>
<LINE>Drawn by report, advent&#8217;rous by desire,</LINE>
<LINE>Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,</LINE>
<LINE>That without covering, save yon field of stars,</LINE>
<LINE>Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid&#8217;s wars;</LINE>
<LINE>And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist</LINE>
<LINE>For going on death&#8217;s net, whom none resist.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught</LINE>
<LINE>My frail mortality to know itself,</LINE>
<LINE>And by those fearful objects to prepare</LINE>
<LINE>This body, like to them, to what I must;</LINE>
<LINE>For death remembered should be like a mirror,</LINE>
<LINE>Who tells us life&#8217;s but breath, to trust it error.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll make my will then, and as sick men do,</LINE>
<LINE>Who know the world, see heaven, but feeling woe,</LINE>
<LINE>Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;</LINE>
<LINE>So I bequeath a happy peace to you</LINE>
<LINE>And all good men, as every prince should do;</LINE>
<LINE>My riches to the earth from whence they came;</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To the Princess.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But my unspotted fire of love to you.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus ready for the way of life or death,</LINE>
<LINE>I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Scorning advice, read the conclusion then;</LINE>
<LINE>Which read and not expounded, &#8217;tis decreed,</LINE>
<LINE>As these before thee, thou thyself shalt bleed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUGH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of all &#8217;say&#8217;d yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!</LINE>
<LINE>Of all &#8217;say&#8217;d yet, I wish thee happiness!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Like a bold champion I assume the lists,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor ask advice of any other thought</LINE>
<LINE>But faithfulness and courage.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Reads.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>The Riddle</STAGEDIR>
<LINE><RECITE>I am no viper, yet I feed</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>On mother&#8217;s flesh which did me breed.</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>I sought a husband, in which labor</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>I found that kindness in a father.</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>He&#8217;s father, son, and husband mild;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>I mother, wife&#8212;and yet his child.</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>How they may be, and yet in two,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>As you will live, resolve it you.</RECITE></LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sharp physic is the last. But O you powers!</LINE>
<LINE>That gives heaven countless eyes to view men&#8217;s acts,</LINE>
<LINE>Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,</LINE>
<LINE>If this be true which makes me pale to read it?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside to the Princess.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Fair glass of light, I lov&#8217;d you, and could still,</LINE>
<LINE>Were not this glorious casket stor&#8217;d with ill.</LINE>
<LINE>But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt,</LINE>
<LINE>For he&#8217;s no man on whom perfections wait</LINE>
<LINE>That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.</LINE>
<LINE>You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, finger&#8217;d to make man his lawful music,</LINE>
<LINE>Would draw heaven down, and all the gods to hearken;</LINE>
<LINE>But being play&#8217;d upon before your time,</LINE>
<LINE>Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.</LINE>
<LINE>Good sooth, I care not for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life,</LINE>
<LINE>For that&#8217;s an article within our law,</LINE>
<LINE>As dangerous as the rest. Your time&#8217;s expir&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Either expound now, or receive your sentence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Great King,</LINE>
<LINE>Few love to hear the sins they love to act;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.</LINE>
<LINE>Who has a book of all that monarchs do,</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;s more secure to keep it shut than shown;</LINE>
<LINE>For vice repeated is like the wand&#8217;ring wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Blows dust in others&#8217; eyes, to spread itself;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,</LINE>
<LINE>The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear</LINE>
<LINE>To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts</LINE>
<LINE>Copp&#8217;d hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>By man&#8217;s oppression, and the poor worm doth die for&#8217;t.</LINE>
<LINE>Kings are earth&#8217;s gods; in vice their law&#8217;s their will;</LINE>
<LINE>And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?</LINE>
<LINE>It is enough you know, and it is fit,</LINE>
<LINE>What being more known grows worse, to smother it.</LINE>
<LINE>All love the womb that their first being bred,</LINE>
<LINE>Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER><STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Heaven, that I had thy head! He has found the meaning.</LINE>
<LINE>But I will gloze with him.&#8212;Young Prince of Tyre,</LINE>
<LINE>Though by the tenor of our strict edict,</LINE>
<LINE>Your exposition misinterpreting,</LINE>
<LINE>We might proceed to cancel of your days;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree</LINE>
<LINE>As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise.</LINE>
<LINE>Forty days longer we do respite you;</LINE>
<LINE>If by which time our secret be undone,</LINE>
<LINE>This mercy shows we&#8217;ll joy in such a son;</LINE>
<LINE>And until then your entertain shall be</LINE>
<LINE>As doth befit our honor and your worth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt. Manet Pericles solus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How courtesy would seem to cover sin,</LINE>
<LINE>When what is done is like an hypocrite,</LINE>
<LINE>The which is good in nothing but in sight!</LINE>
<LINE>If it be true that I interpret false,</LINE>
<LINE>Then were it certain you were not so bad</LINE>
<LINE>As with foul incest to abuse your soul;</LINE>
<LINE>Where now you&#8217;re both a father and a son</LINE>
<LINE>By your uncomely claspings with your child</LINE>
<LINE>(Which pleasures fits a husband, not a father),</LINE>
<LINE>And she an eater of her mother&#8217;s flesh</LINE>
<LINE>By the defiling of her parent&#8217;s bed;</LINE>
<LINE>And both like serpents are, who though they feed</LINE>
<LINE>On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.</LINE>
<LINE>Antioch, farewell, for wisdom sees those men</LINE>
<LINE>Blush not in actions blacker than the night</LINE>
<LINE>Will &#8217;schew no course to keep them from the light.</LINE>
<LINE>One sin, I know, another doth provoke:</LINE>
<LINE>Murder&#8217;s as near to lust as flame to smoke;</LINE>
<LINE>Poison and treason are the hands of sin,</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, and the targets to put off the shame;</LINE>
<LINE>Then lest my life be cropp&#8217;d to keep you clear,</LINE>
<LINE>By flight I&#8217;ll shun the danger which I fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Antiochus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath found the meaning,</LINE>
<LINE>For which we mean to have his head.</LINE>
<LINE>He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin</LINE>
<LINE>In such a loathed manner;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore instantly this prince must die,</LINE>
<LINE>For by his fall my honor must keep high.</LINE>
<LINE>Who attends us there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Thaliard.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Doth your Highness call?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thaliard&#8212;you are of our chamber, Thaliard,</LINE>
<LINE>And our mind partakes her private actions</LINE>
<LINE>To your secrecy; and for your faithfulness</LINE>
<LINE>We will advance you, Thaliard. Behold,</LINE>
<LINE>Here&#8217;s poison and here&#8217;s gold; we hate the Prince</LINE>
<LINE>Of Tyre, and thou must kill him. It fits thee not</LINE>
<LINE>To ask the reason why, because we bid it.</LINE>
<LINE>Say, is it done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">My lord, &#8217;tis done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Enough.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter an Antiochan Messenger.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT. MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, Prince Pericles is fled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">As thou</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt live, fly after, and like an arrow shot</LINE>
<LINE>From a well-experienc&#8217;d archer hits the mark</LINE>
<LINE>His eye doth level at, so thou never return</LINE>
<LINE>Unless thou say Prince Pericles is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord,</LINE>
<LINE>If I can get him within my pistol&#8217;s length,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll make him sure enough; so farewell to your Highness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thaliard, <FRENCH lang="fr">adieu</FRENCH>!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Thaliard.</STAGEDIR>

<SCENELOCATION>Tyre. A room in the palace.</SCENELOCATION>
<SCENEPERSONAE>(Pericles, Lords of Tyre, Helicanus)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Pericles with his Lords.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let none disturb us.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Lords.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="4">Why should this change of thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>The sad companion, dull-ey&#8217;d melancholy,</LINE>
<LINE>Be my so us&#8217;d a guest as not an hour</LINE>
<LINE>In the day&#8217;s glorious walk or peaceful night,</LINE>
<LINE>The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?</LINE>
<LINE>Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,</LINE>
<LINE>And danger, which I fear&#8217;d, is at Antioch,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose arm seems far too short to hit me here.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet neither pleasure&#8217;s art can joy my spirits,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor yet the other&#8217;s distance comfort me.</LINE>
<LINE>Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,</LINE>
<LINE>That have their first conception by misdread,</LINE>
<LINE>Have after-nourishment and life by care;</LINE>
<LINE>And what was first but fear what might be done,</LINE>
<LINE>Grows elder now, and cares it be not done.</LINE>
<LINE>And so with me: the great Antiochus,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Gainst whom I am too little to contend,</LINE>
<LINE>Since he&#8217;s so great can make his will his act,</LINE>
<LINE>Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor boots it me to say I honor him,</LINE>
<LINE>If he suspect I may dishonor him;</LINE>
<LINE>And what may make him blush in being known,</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;ll stop the course by which it might be known.</LINE>
<LINE>With hostile forces he&#8217;ll o&#8217;erspread the land,</LINE>
<LINE>And with th&#8217; ostent of war will look so huge,</LINE>
<LINE>Amazement shall drive courage from the state,</LINE>
<LINE>Our men be vanquish&#8217;d ere they do resist,</LINE>
<LINE>And subjects punish&#8217;d that ne&#8217;er thought offense:</LINE>
<LINE>Which care of them, not pity of myself&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Who am no more but as the tops of trees,</LINE>
<LINE>Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,</LINE>
<LINE>And punish that before that he would punish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.</LINE>
<LINE>They do abuse the King that flatter him,</LINE>
<LINE>For flattery is the bellows blows up sin,</LINE>
<LINE>The thing the which is flattered, but a spark</LINE>
<LINE>To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;</LINE>
<LINE>Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,</LINE>
<LINE>Fits kings as they are men, for they may err.</LINE>
<LINE>When Signior Sooth here does proclaim peace,</LINE>
<LINE>He flatters you, makes war upon your life.</LINE>
<LINE>Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot be much lower than my knees.</LINE>

<LINE>All leave us else; but let your cares o&#8217;erlook</LINE>

<LINE>Rise, prithee rise. Sit down. Thou art</LINE>
<LINE>No flatterer. I thank thee for&#8217;t, and heaven forbid</LINE>
<LINE>That kings should let their ears hear their faults hid!</LINE>
<LINE>Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,</LINE>

<LINE>Thou speak&#8217;st like a physician, Helicanus,</LINE>

<LINE>That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.</LINE>
<LINE>Attend me then: I went to Antioch,</LINE>
<LINE>Where, as thou know&#8217;st, against the face of death</LINE>
<LINE>I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty,</LINE>
<LINE>From whence an issue I might propagate,</LINE>

<LINE>Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;</LINE>
<LINE>The rest (hark in thine ear) as black as incest,</LINE>
<LINE>Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father</LINE>
<LINE>Seem&#8217;d not to strike, but smooth. But thou know&#8217;st this,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis time to fear when tyrants seems to kiss.</LINE>
<LINE>Which fear so grew in me, I hither fled,</LINE>
<LINE>Under the covering of a careful night,</LINE>
<LINE>Who seem&#8217;d my good protector, and being here,</LINE>
<LINE>Bethought what was past, what might succeed.</LINE>
<LINE>I knew him tyrannous, and tyrants&#8217; fears</LINE>
<LINE>Decrease not, but grow faster than the years;</LINE>
<LINE>And should he doubt &#8217;t, as no doubt he doth,</LINE>
<LINE>That I should open to the list&#8217;ning air</LINE>
<LINE>How many worthy princes&#8217; bloods were shed</LINE>
<LINE>To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,</LINE>
<LINE>To lop that doubt, he&#8217;ll fill this land with arms,</LINE>
<LINE>And make pretense of wrong that I have done him;</LINE>
<LINE>When all, for mine, if I may call offense,</LINE>
<LINE>Must feel war&#8217;s blow, who spares not innocence:</LINE>
<LINE>Which love to all, of which thyself art one,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts</LINE>
<LINE>How I might stop this tempest ere it came,</LINE>
<LINE>And finding little comfort to relieve them,</LINE>
<LINE>I thought it princely charity to grieve for them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak,</LINE>
<LINE>Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,</LINE>
<LINE>And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,</LINE>
<LINE>Who either by public war or private treason</LINE>
<LINE>Will take away your life.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,</LINE>
<LINE>Till that his rage and anger be forgot,</LINE>
<LINE>Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.</LINE>
<LINE>Your rule direct to any; if to me,</LINE>
<LINE>Day serves not light more faithful than I&#8217;ll be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>We&#8217;ll mingle our bloods together in the earth,</LINE>

<LINE>Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tharsus</LINE>
<LINE>Intend my travel, where I&#8217;ll hear from thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And by whose letters I&#8217;ll dispose myself.</LINE>
<LINE>The care I had and have of subjects&#8217; good</LINE>
<LINE>On thee I lay, whose wisdom&#8217;s strength can bear it.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:</LINE>
<LINE>Who shuns not to break one will crack them both;</LINE>
<LINE>But in our orbs we&#8217;ll live so round and safe,</LINE>
<LINE>That time of both this truth shall ne&#8217;er convince,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to be hang&#8217;d at home. &#8217;Tis dangerous. Well, I perceive he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that, being bid to ask what he would of the king, desir&#8217;d he might know none of his secrets. Now do I see he had some reason for&#8217;t; for if a king bid a man be a villain, he&#8217;s bound by the indenture of his oath to be one. Husht! Here comes the lords of Tyre.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Royal Antiochus, on what cause I know not,</LINE>

<LINE>And doubting lest he had err&#8217;d or sinn&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>To show his sorrow, he&#8217;d correct himself;</LINE>
<LINE>So puts himself unto the shipman&#8217;s toil,</LINE>
<LINE>With whom each minute threatens life or death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAL.</SPEAKER><STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Well, I perceive</LINE>
<LINE>I shall not be hang&#8217;d now, although I would;</LINE>
<LINE>But since he&#8217;s gone, the King&#8217;s seas must please:</LINE>
<LINE>He scap&#8217;d the land to perish at the sea.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll present myself.&#8212;Peace to the lords of Tyre!</LINE>

<LINE>We have no reason to desire it,</LINE>

<LINE>O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;</LINE>
<LINE>Here they are but felt, and seen with mischief&#8217;s eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>But like to groves, being topp&#8217;d, they higher rise.</LINE>

<LINE>Fetch breath that may proclaim them louder, that</LINE>
<LINE>If heaven slumber, while their creatures want,</LINE>
<LINE>They may awake their helpers to comfort them.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll then discourse our woes, felt several years,</LINE>

<LINE>Their tables were stor&#8217;d full, to glad the sight,</LINE>

<LINE>All poverty was scorn&#8217;d, and pride so great,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DION.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, &#8217;tis too true.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>But see what heaven can do by this our change:</LINE>

<LINE>Were all too little to content and please,</LINE>
<LINE>Although they gave their creatures in abundance,</LINE>
<LINE>As houses are defil&#8217;d for want of use,</LINE>
<LINE>They are now starv&#8217;d for want of exercise;</LINE>
<LINE>Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,</LINE>
<LINE>Must have inventions to delight the taste,</LINE>
<LINE>Would now be glad of bread and beg for it;</LINE>
<LINE>Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,</LINE>
<LINE>Thought nought too curious, are ready now</LINE>
<LINE>To eat those little darlings whom they lov&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>So sharp are hunger&#8217;s teeth, that man and wife</LINE>
<LINE>Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life.</LINE>
<LINE>Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;</LINE>
<LINE>Here many sink, yet those which see them fall</LINE>
<LINE>Have scarce strength left to give them burial.</LINE>
<LINE>Is not this true?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thought as much.</LINE>
<LINE>One sorrow never comes but brings an heir</LINE>
<LINE>That may succeed as his inheritor;</LINE>

<LINE>Taking advantage of our misery,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath stuff&#8217;d the hollow vessels with their power</LINE>

<LINE>Alas, the seas hath cast me on the rocks,</LINE>
<LINE>Wash&#8217;d me from shore to shore, and left me breath</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing to think on but ensuing death.</LINE>
<LINE>Let it suffice the greatness of your powers</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. FISH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the porpas how he bounc&#8217;d and tumbled? They say they&#8217;re half fish, half flesh. A plague on them, they ne&#8217;er come but I look to be wash&#8217;d. Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. FISH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the little ones. I can compare our rich misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale: &#8217;a plays and tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at last devour them all at a mouthful. Such whales have I heard on a&#8217; th&#8217; land, who never leave gaping till they swallow&#8217;d the whole parish, church, steeple, bells, and all.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. FISH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. FISH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because he should have swallow&#8217;d me too, and when I had been in his belly, I would have kept such a jangling of the bells, that he should never have left till he cast bells, steeple, church, and parish up again. But if the good King Simonides were of my mind&#8212;</LINE>

<LINE>It&#8217;s fit it should be so, for princes are</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD. PENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He had need mean better than his outward show</LINE>
<LINE>Can any way speak in his just commend;</LINE>
<LINE>For by his rusty outside he appears</LINE>
<LINE>To have practic&#8217;d more the whipstock than the lance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. LORD. PENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He well may be a stranger, for he comes</LINE>
<LINE>To an honor&#8217;d triumph strangely furnished.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. LORD. PENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And on set purpose let his armor rust</LINE>
<LINE>Until this day, to scour it in the dust.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Opinion&#8217;s but a fool, that makes us scan</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Knights,</LINE>
<LINE>To say you&#8217;re welcome were superfluous.</LINE>
<LINE>To place upon the volume of your deeds,</LINE>
<LINE>As in a title-page, your worth in arms,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>He&#8217;s but a country gentleman:</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Yon king&#8217;s to me like to my father&#8217;s picture,</LINE>
<LINE>Which tells me in that glory once he was;</LINE>
<LINE>Had princes sit like stars about his throne,</LINE>
<LINE>And he the sun for them to reverence;</LINE>
<LINE>None that beheld him but, like lesser lights,</LINE>
<LINE>Did vail their crowns to his supremacy;</LINE>
<LINE>Where now his son&#8217;s like a glow-worm in the night,</LINE>
<LINE>The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:</LINE>
<LINE>Whereby I see that Time&#8217;s the king of men,</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;s both their parent, and he is their grave,</LINE>
<LINE>And gives them what he will, not what they crave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Princes in this should live like gods above,</LINE>
<LINE>Who freely give to every one that come</LINE>
<LINE>To honor them;</LINE>
<LINE>And princes not doing so are like to gnats,</LINE>
<LINE>Which make a sound, but kill&#8217;d are wond&#8217;red at.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,</LINE>
<LINE>Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, my father, it befits not me</LINE>
<LINE>Unto a stranger knight to be so bold.</LINE>
<LINE>He may my proffer take for an offense,</LINE>
<LINE>Since men take women&#8217;s gifts for impudence.</LINE>

<LINE>Now by the gods, I pity his misfortune,</LINE>

<LINE>Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,</LINE>
<LINE>And waste the time, which looks for other revels.</LINE>
<LINE>Even in your armors, as you are address&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Will well become a soldier&#8217;s dance.</LINE>
<LINE>I will not have excuse with saying this,</LINE>
<LINE>Loud music is too harsh for ladies&#8217; heads,</LINE>
<LINE>Since they love men in arms as well as beds.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>They dance.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>So, this was well ask&#8217;d, &#8217;twas so well perform&#8217;d.</LINE>

<LINE>When he was seated in a chariot</LINE>
<LINE>Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him,</LINE>
<LINE>A fire from heaven came and shrivell&#8217;d up</LINE>
<LINE>Those bodies, even to loathing; for they so stunk,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ESCA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Twas very strange.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>2. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It shall no longer grieve without reproof.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know that our griefs are risen to the top,</LINE>
<LINE>And now at length they overflow their banks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your griefs, for what? Wrong not your prince you love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wrong not yourself then, noble Helicane;</LINE>
<LINE>But if the Prince do live, let us salute him,</LINE>
<LINE>Or know what ground&#8217;s made happy by his breath.</LINE>
<LINE>If in the world he live, we&#8217;ll seek him out;</LINE>
<LINE>If in his grave he rest, we&#8217;ll find him there;</LINE>
<LINE>And be resolved he lives to govern us,</LINE>
<LINE>Or dead, give &#8217;s cause to mourn his funeral,</LINE>
<LINE>And leave us to our free election.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whose death indeed the strongest in our censure,</LINE>
<LINE>And knowing this kingdom is without a head&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Like goodly buildings left without a roof</LINE>
<LINE>Soon fall to ruin&#8212;your noble self,</LINE>
<LINE>That best know how to rule and how to reign,</LINE>
<LINE>We thus submit unto&#8212;our sovereign.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Try honor&#8217;s cause; forbear your suffrages.</LINE>
<LINE>If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear.</LINE>
<LINE>Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,</LINE>
<LINE>Where&#8217;s hourly trouble for a minute&#8217;s ease.</LINE>
<LINE>A twelvemonth longer let me entreat you</LINE>
<LINE>To forbear the absence of your king;</LINE>
<LINE>If in which time expir&#8217;d he not return,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.</LINE>
<LINE>But if I cannot win you to this love,</LINE>
<LINE>Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,</LINE>
<LINE>And in your search spend your adventurous worth;</LINE>
<LINE>Whom if you find, and win unto return,</LINE>
<LINE>You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To wisdom he&#8217;s a fool that will not yield;</LINE>

<LINE offset="4">who, for aught I know,</LINE>

<LINE>Therefore hear you, mistress, either frame</LINE>

<LINE>The cat, with eyne of burning coal,</LINE>
<LINE>Now couches from the mouse&#8217;s hole;</LINE>
<LINE>And crickets sing at the oven&#8217;s mouth,</LINE>
<LINE>Are the blither for their drouth.</LINE>
<LINE>Hymen hath brought the bride to bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Where, by the loss of maidenhead,</LINE>
<LINE>A babe is moulded. Be attent,</LINE>
<LINE>And time that is so briefly spent</LINE>
<LINE>With your fine fancies quaintly eche:</LINE>
<LINE>What&#8217;s dumb in show I&#8217;ll plain with speech.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Dumb Show.</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Pericles and Simonides, at one door, with Attendants. The Second Tyrian Messenger meets them, kneels, and gives Pericles a letter. Pericles shows it Simonides; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter Thaisa with child, with Lychorida, a nurse. The King shows her the letter; she rejoices. She and Pericles take leave of her father, and depart with Lychorida and their Attendants. Then exeunt Simonides and the rest.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>By many a dern and painful perch,</LINE>
<LINE>Of Pericles the careful search,</LINE>
<LINE>By the four opposing coigns</LINE>
<LINE>Which the world together joins,</LINE>
<LINE>Is made with all due diligence</LINE>
<LINE>That horse and sail and high expense</LINE>
<LINE>Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,</LINE>
<LINE>Fame answering the most strange inquire,</LINE>
<LINE>To th&#8217; court of King Simonides</LINE>
<LINE>Are letters brought, the tenor these:</LINE>
<LINE>Antiochus and his daughter dead,</LINE>
<LINE>The men of Tyrus on the head</LINE>
<LINE>Of Helicanus would set on</LINE>
<LINE>The crown of Tyre, but he will none.</LINE>
<LINE>The mutiny he there hastes t&#8217; oppress,</LINE>
<LINE>Says to &#8217;em, if King Pericles</LINE>
<LINE>Come not home in twice six moons,</LINE>
<LINE>He, obedient to their dooms,</LINE>
<LINE>Will take the crown. The sum of this,</LINE>
<LINE>Brought hither to Pentapolis,</LINE>
<LINE>Yravished the regions round,</LINE>
<LINE>And every one with claps can sound,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Our heir-apparent is a king!</LINE>
<LINE>Who dreamt? Who thought of such a thing?&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:</LINE>
<LINE>His queen, with child, makes her desire&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Which who shall cross?&#8212;along to go.</LINE>
<LINE>Omit we all their dole and woe.</LINE>
<LINE>Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,</LINE>
<LINE>And so to sea. Their vessel shakes</LINE>
<LINE>On Neptune&#8217;s billow; half the flood</LINE>
<LINE>Hath their keel cut. But fortune, mov&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Varies again; the grisled north</LINE>
<LINE>Disgorges such a tempest forth,</LINE>
<LINE>That, as a duck for life that dives,</LINE>
<LINE>So up and down the poor ship drives.</LINE>
<LINE>The lady shrieks, and well-a-near</LINE>
<LINE>Does fall in travail with her fear;</LINE>
<LINE>And what ensues in this fell storm</LINE>
<LINE>Shall for itself itself perform.</LINE>
<LINE>I nill relate, action may</LINE>

<LINE>&#8217;T &#8217;as been a turbulent and stormy night.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EPH. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have been in many; but such a night as this</LINE>

<SPEAKER>1. GENT. EPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Good morrow.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT. EPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow to your lordship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Gentlemen,</LINE>
<LINE>Why do you stir so early?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT. EPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Shook as the earth did quake;</LINE>
<LINE>The very principals did seem to rend,</LINE>
<LINE>And all to topple. Pure surprise and fear</LINE>
<LINE>Made me to quit the house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT. EPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is the cause we trouble you so early,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not our husbandry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">O, you say well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT. EPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I much marvel that your lordship, having</LINE>
<LINE>Rich tire about you, should at these early hours</LINE>
<LINE>Shake off the golden slumber of repose.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis most strange</LINE>
<LINE>Nature should be so conversant with pain,</LINE>
<LINE>Being thereto not compelled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">I hold it ever</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue and cunning were endowments greater</LINE>
<LINE>Than nobleness and riches. Careless heirs</LINE>
<LINE>May the two latter darken and expend;</LINE>
<LINE>But immortality attends the former,</LINE>
<LINE>Making a man a god. &#8217;Tis known, I ever</LINE>
<LINE>Have studied physic; through which secret art,</LINE>
<LINE>By turning o&#8217;er authorities, I have,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with my practice, made familiar</LINE>
<LINE>To me and to my aid the blest infusions</LINE>
<LINE>That dwells in vegetives, in metals, stones;</LINE>
<LINE>And can speak of the disturbances</LINE>
<LINE>That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me</LINE>
<LINE>A more content in course of true delight</LINE>
<LINE>Than to be thirsty after tottering honor,</LINE>
<LINE>Or tie my pleasure up in silken bags,</LINE>
<LINE>To please the fool and death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT. EPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your honor has through Ephesus pour&#8217;d forth</LINE>
<LINE>Your charity, and hundreds call themselves</LINE>
<LINE>Your creatures, who by you have been restored;</LINE>
<LINE>And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even</LINE>
<LINE>Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon</LINE>
<LINE>Such strong renown as time shall never&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter two or three of Cerimon&#8217;s Servants with a chest.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CER. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Sir, even now</LINE>
<LINE>Did the sea toss up upon our shore this chest.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis of some wrack.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT. EPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis like a coffin, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">What e&#8217;er it be,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight.</LINE>
<LINE>If the sea&#8217;s stomach be o&#8217;ercharg&#8217;d with gold,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT. EPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis so, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">How close &#8217;tis caulk&#8217;d and bitum&#8217;d!</LINE>
<LINE>Did the sea cast it up?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CER. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I never saw so huge a billow, sir,</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">Wrench it open.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT. EPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A delicate odor.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CER.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>O you most potent gods! What&#8217;s here? A corse?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT. EPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most strange.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shrouded in cloth of state, balm&#8217;d and entreasur&#8217;d</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Reads from a scroll.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE><RECITE>&#8220;Here I give to understand,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>If e&#8217;er this coffin drives a-land,</RECITE></LINE>

<LINE>If thou livest, Pericles, thou hast a heart</LINE>

<LINE>Most likely, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Nay, certainly tonight,</LINE>
<LINE>For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough</LINE>
<LINE>That threw her in the sea. Make a fire within.</LINE>
<LINE>Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit a Servant.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Death may usurp on nature many hours,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet the fire of life kindle again</LINE>
<LINE>The o&#8217;erpress&#8217;d spirits. I heard of an Egyptian</LINE>
<LINE>That had nine hours lien dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Who was by good appliance recovered.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter one with boxes, napkins, and fire.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Well said, well said. The fire and cloths.</LINE>
<LINE>The rough and woeful music that we have,</LINE>
<LINE>Cause it to sound, beseech you.</LINE>
<LINE>The vial once more. How thou stir&#8217;st, thou block!</LINE>
<LINE>The music there! I pray you give her air.</LINE>
<LINE>Gentlemen, this queen will live. Nature awakes,</LINE>
<LINE>A warmth breathes out of her. She hath not been</LINE>
<LINE>Entranc&#8217;d above five hours. See how she gins</LINE>
<LINE>To blow into life&#8217;s flower again!</LINE>

<LINE offset="4">She is alive; behold</LINE>

<LINE>Now to Marina bend your mind,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom our fast-growing scene must find</LINE>
<LINE>At Tharsus, and by Cleon train&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>In music&#8217;s letters, who hath gain&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Of education all the grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Which makes her both th&#8217; heart and place</LINE>
<LINE>Of general wonder. But alack,</LINE>
<LINE>That monster Envy, oft the wrack</LINE>
<LINE>Of earned praise, Marina&#8217;s life</LINE>
<LINE>Seeks to take off by treason&#8217;s knife,</LINE>
<LINE>And in this kind: our Cleon hath</LINE>
<LINE>One daughter, and a full-grown wench,</LINE>
<LINE>Even ripe for marriage rite; this maid</LINE>
<LINE>Hight Philoten, and it is said</LINE>
<LINE>For certain in our story, she</LINE>
<LINE>Would ever with Marina be:</LINE>
<LINE>Be&#8217;t when they weav&#8217;d the sleided silk</LINE>
<LINE>With fingers long, small, white as milk;</LINE>
<LINE>Or when she would with sharp needle wound</LINE>
<LINE>The cambric, which she made more sound</LINE>
<LINE>By hurting it; or when to th&#8217; lute</LINE>
<LINE>She sung, and made the night-bird mute,</LINE>
<LINE>That still records with moan; or when</LINE>
<LINE>She would with rich and constant pen</LINE>
<LINE>Vail to her mistress Dian; still</LINE>
<LINE>This Philoten contends in skill</LINE>
<LINE>With absolute Marina: so</LINE>
<LINE>The dove of Paphos might with the crow</LINE>

<LINE>All praises, which are paid as debts,</LINE>

<LINE>A present murderer does prepare</LINE>
<LINE>For good Marina, that her daughter</LINE>
<LINE>Might stand peerless by this slaughter.</LINE>
<LINE>The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,</LINE>

<LINE>We were never so much out of creatures. We have but poor three, and they can do no more than they can do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor the commodity wages not with the danger; therefore if in our youths we could pick up some pretty estate, &#8217;twere not amiss to keep our door hatch&#8217;d. Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods will be strong with us for giving o&#8217;er.</LINE>

<LINE>Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?</LINE>

<LINE>Faith, they listen&#8217;d to me as they would have hearken&#8217;d to their father&#8217;s testament. There was a Spaniard&#8217;s mouth wat&#8217;red, and he went to bed to her very description.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BAWD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We shall have him here tomorrow with his best ruff on.</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, he, he offer&#8217;d to cut a caper at the proclamation, but he made a groan at it, and swore he would see her tomorrow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAWD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, well, as for him, he brought his disease hither; here he does but repair it. I know he will come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the sun.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we should lodge them with this sign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAWD.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>To Marina.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Pray you come hither a while. You have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must seem to do that fearfully which you commit willingly, despise profit where you have most gain. To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your lovers; seldom but that pity begets you a good opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I understand you not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, take her home, mistress, take her home. These blushes of hers must be quench&#8217;d with some present practice.</LINE>

<LINE>Boult, spend thou that in the town. Report what a sojoumer we have; You&#8217;ll lose nothing by custom. When nature fram&#8217;d this piece, she meant thee a good turn; therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou hast the harvest out of thine own report.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stirs up the lewdly inclin&#8217;d. I&#8217;ll bring home some tonight.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DION.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,</LINE>

<LINE>But cast their gazes on Marina&#8217;s face;</LINE>
<LINE>Whilest ours was blurted at and held a mawkin</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she had ne&#8217;er come here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAWD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, fie upon her, she&#8217;s able to freeze the god Priapus, and undo a whole generation. We must either get her ravish&#8217;d or be rid of her. When she should do for clients her fitment, and do me the kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks, her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, her knees, that she would make a puritan of the devil, if he should cheapen a kiss of her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, I must ravish her, or she&#8217;ll disfurnish us of all our cavalleria, and make our swearers priests.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now the pox upon her green-sickness for me!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAWD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, there&#8217;s no way to be rid on&#8217;t but by the way to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguis&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We should have both lord and lown, if the peevish baggage would but give way to customers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Lysimachus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now? How a dozen of virginities?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAWD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now the gods to bless your honor!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am glad to see your honor in good health.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may so, &#8217;tis the better for you that your resorters stand upon sound legs. How now? Wholesome iniquity have you, that a man may deal withal and defy the surgeon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAWD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have here one, sir, if she would&#8212;but there never came her like in Mytilene.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If she&#8217;d do the deeds of darkness, thou wouldst say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAWD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your honor knows what &#8217;tis to say well enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Well, call forth, call forth.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall see a rose, and she were a rose indeed, if she had but&#8212;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, prithee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, I can be modest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than it gives a good report to a number to be chaste.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAWD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here comes that which grows to the stalk, never pluck&#8217;d yet, I can assure you.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Boult with Marina.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Is she not a fair creature?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea. Well, there&#8217;s for you, leave us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAWD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I beseech your honor give me leave a word, and I&#8217;ll have done presently.</LINE>

<LINE>I beseech you do.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside to Marina.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>First, I would have you note, this is an honorable man.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAWD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Next, he&#8217;s the governor of this country, and a man whom I am bound to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he govern the country, you are bound to him indeed, but how honorable he is in that, I know not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAWD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, will you use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha&#8217; you done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAWD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, she&#8217;s not pac&#8217;d yet, you must take some pains to work her to your manage. Come, we will leave his honor and her together. Go thy ways.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, your herb-woman, she that sets seeds and roots of shame and iniquity. O, you have heard something of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious wooing.

<LINE>Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty</LINE>

<LINE>For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,</LINE>

<LINE>In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard</LINE>
<LINE>Of monstrous lust the due and just reward.</LINE>
<LINE>In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,</LINE>
<LINE>Although assail&#8217;d with fortune fierce and keen,</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue preserv&#8217;d from fell destruction&#8217;s blast,</LINE>
<LINE>Led on by heaven, and crown&#8217;d with joy at last.</LINE>
<LINE>In Helicanus may you well descry</LINE>
<LINE>A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty.</LINE>
<LINE>In reverend Cerimon there well appears</LINE>
<LINE>The worth that learned charity aye wears.</LINE>
<LINE>For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame</LINE>
<LINE>Had spread his cursed deed, the honor&#8217;d name</LINE>
<LINE>Of Pericles to rage the city turn,</LINE>
<LINE>That him and his they in his palace burn;</LINE>
<LINE>The gods for murder seemed so content</LINE>
<LINE>To punish, although not done, but meant.</LINE>
<LINE>So, on your patience evermore attending,</LINE>
<LINE>New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.</LINE>
